      "### Actors in Bullet\n",
      "\n",
      "Static bodies can be concave or convex, but dynamic bodies must be convex. However, dynamic collision shapes can be compound, meaning it is a collision shape made of other collision shapes. So, a concave collision shape can be created in the dynamic case by building it out of a group of convex shapes. This can be done using multiple SOPs. Each SOP must be convex, but combination of the SOPs does not need to be. If Automatic mode is selected, then a compound collision shape will be created from these SOPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All bodies in an Actor COMP have a corresponding collision shape. The collision shape is what determines how objects will collide with one another, and it is important to note that what is seen in the viewer/render will not necessarily directly match the collision shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collision shapes are created using SOPs, either through the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter or by putting them inside the Actor COMP itself. If the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter is filled in, then the Actor COMP will create a single body from all the SOPs at that given paths (if the path is a COMP then it will recursively grab all the SOPs in the COMP). If there is nothing filled in for the \"Collision SOPs\" parameter, then the Actor COMP will instead recursively search inside itself for any SOPs that have both their display and render flags on. The Actor COMP will create a single body and corresponding collision shape from these SOPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are several options when it comes to creating a collision shape out of the SOPs. These options can be chosen from the \"Collision Shape\" parameter. For instance, the option \"Oriented Bounding Box\" will create a minimum volume bounding box around the selected SOPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To create multiple bodies, use the instancing on the \"Instance\" page of the Actor COMP. This will create any number of identical bodies, each with their own identical collision shape. Currently there is no way to create multiple non-identical bodies in a single Actor COMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bodies are initialized using the \"Initialize Actor\" parameter, so if any changes are made to the SOPs that create the bodies, then the Actor COMP must be reinitialized. Bodies will automatically be re-initialized if the Kinematic State, Shape, or Center of Mass is changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transforms can be applied to an Actor COMP using the Xform and Pre-Xform pages, much like on a Geometry COMP or Camera COMP. The transforms on the Xform and Pre-Xform pages create the initial transform of the actor in the simulation, but they can also be used to modify the transform of an actor during a simulation. Changing scale on either page will require a reinitialization of the actor since it changes the collision shape itself. Modifying any of the transforms while instancing will automatically reinitialize the actor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actor COMPs cannot be nested; however, Actor COMPs can be nested inside Geometry COMPs and vice versa. Geometry COMPs with a nested Actor COMPs cannot have any scale transform; however, Geometry COMPs nested inside an Actor COMP can have scale. An Actor COMP nested inside Geometry COMPs will use their transform only when it is initialized. Therefore, any changes to the transform of these Geometry COMPs will require a reinitialization of the Actor COMP.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Actors in Flex\n",
      "\n",
      "[Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex \"Flex\") actors can either be fluid particles, a fluid particle emitter, or a static shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Static shapes in Flex are built in the same way that concave (ie. static) shapes are built in Bullet. Static shapes require a triangle mesh SOP to build up their collision shape. However, box/sphere collision shape options can also be used to create a bounding box/sphere of the collision shape SOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluid particles behave much the same way as instancing on a Bullet actor. The number of fluid particles is equal to the number of instances created from an instance OP. The instance parameters are used to give the particle an initial transform, but once the simulation is running the transform is updated from the simulation results.\n",
      "\n",
      "One key difference of a fluid particle Actor COMP is that no SOP is needed to create a fluid particle since their size/behaviour is defined through the simulation parameters on the [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html \"Nvidia Flex Solver COMP\"). A SOP in the Actor COMP can be used to the render/display the positions of the particles. Alternatively, the particle positions can be fetched using the [Nvidia Flex TOP](Nvidia_Flex_TOP.html \"Nvidia Flex TOP\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluid emitters add particles to the scene at the emission point (ie. the transform of the Actor COMP). Particles are added up until the emission maximum is reached, at which point emission particles will be recycled from already existing particles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using an Actor COMP\n",
      "\n",
      "When creating an Actor COMP there are some important questions to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Will this Actor be in a Bullet or Flex simulation?** There are many commonalities between Bullet actors and Flex actors, however they do differ in their functionality, meaning that not all parameters overlap. For Bullet specific parameters see the Bullet page of the Actor COMP and for Flex specific parameters see the Flex page of the Actor COMP.\n",
      "* **Will the bodies move?** A moving body's Kinematic State must be dynamic. A static body can \"move\" by overriding its position, but this is not recommended since clipping can easily occur and and collisions will be incorrect (because the bodies won't have momentum).\n",
      "* **What SOPs will be used to create the collision shape?** Every Actor COMP has a corresponding collision shape that is created from SOPs. The SOPs can be set through the Collision SOPs parameter, or if that parameter is not set, through the display/render flags of SOPs inside the Actor COMP.\n",
      "* **What collision shape will be used?** The SOPs gathered in the previous stage are used to create the collision shape. Each collision shape has their own pros and cons, which are outlined on the [Bullet Dynamics](Bullet_Dynamics.html \"Bullet Dynamics\") page. The collision shape is what determines how the body will interact with other bodies (ie. collide). The collision shape does not necessarily correspond with what is displayed/rendered. The collision shape can be shown using the Display Collision Shape toggle.\n",
      "* **Will the collision shape be concave?** If the collision shape is concave and static, simply select Concave from the drop-down menu. If the collision shape is to be concave and dynamic then there is an extra step: convex decomposition. The collision shape must be a Compound collision shape (ie. a group of convex collision shapes) where each part of the compound shape is convex, but combined together create a concave shape. Each part of the compound shape is represented using a single SOP. Consider the letter \"T\" as an example. \"T\" is concave so it will need to be split into two separate convex parts: the top line and the bottom line. 2 SOPs would be created (one for each line) for the collision shape that when combined together form the full concave \"T\". If the \"T\" were static however, it could remain as 1 SOP.\n",

      "### Why are my bodies not colliding?\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand why two bodies might not collide it is important to understand that Bullet simulates discretely. Speed, position, constraints, collisions are all calculated on a frame by frame basis, as opposed to continuously. In the case of Bullet, collisions are calculated at the beginning and the end of a frame. What this means is that if a body is moving a large distance every frame it can clip through other bodies, because it's not colliding with it at the beginning or the end of the frame when collision is calculated. In the same vein, if an object is very thin then other bodies will be able to clip through it easier than something with more depth because bodies won't have to move as far in a frame to completely jump over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continuous collision detection (see parameter) helps to fix this by performing collision detection along the movement vector (between start/end of frame) so that collisions happening between the start/end of frame will be caught. This helps significantly with high linear velocity bodies, but not so much high angular velocity bodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple other things to consider changing to fix body \"leaking\":\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Manually limit the velocity of bodies, or lower the strength of the forces being applied.\n",
      "2. Add depth to very thin collision surfaces. If you're using a Grid SOP as a collision surface, consider using a Box SOP instead. Or, if you're using a Box SOP as the collision shape to contain other bodies inside, consider making the collision shape out of 6 individual Box SOPs (one for each side of the box) combined together.\n",

      "Continuous Collision Detection `ccd` - Toggles continuous collision detection on/off for this actor. Typically, collision detection is done discretely, meaning that collision is verified at the beginning/end of a frame. However, if a body is going too fast it will move too far in a single frame and therefore clip through any surfaces (ie. No collision detected). Continuous collision detection improves upon this by performing collision detection at intervals between the body's initial and final positions within a frame. Continuous collision detection can affect performance, so even if the parameter is toggled on it will not be used all the time. It will only be used for bodies moving above a velocity threshold.\n",

The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the \"Instance Textures\" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the \"Texture Index\" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the \"Base Color Map\" texture for a [PBR MAT](PBR_MAT.html \"PBR MAT\"), and the Color Map for all other materials such as the [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html \"Phong MAT\"). For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once.

      "The Anti-Alias TOP uses a screen space antialiasing technique called ‘SMAA: Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing’. Detailed information here: <http://www.iryoku.com/smaa/> It uses an image’s luminance, color or a depth map to detect edges of objects and then applies anti-aliasing to those edges. The current implementation does not yet use the temporal features of it, so each image is individually anti-aliased without requiring knowledge of other frames. It doesn’t require the extra memory that regular Render TOP anti-aliasing does, and avoids work involved with antialiasing polygon edges that are ultimately occluded by another object.\n",

To apply this type of compression, set the threshold to a value which is near the maximum volume that you want to hear. Apply a large compression ratio (around 1.0), and set the attack and release to high values. As the passage of audio crosses the threshold value, compression will slowly be applied, and if set properly, the signal will be compressed to a constant range. Setting the attack and release too low will cause the output volume to waver too quickly, while high values may cause the compression to be applied too slowly.\n",

This is assuming that input signals are normalized to a \"-1 to +1\" range.\n",
      "Ratio `ratiocompressor` - The ratio is the amount of compression that will be applied to the signal, with respect to how far the signal has gone past the threshold value. A ratio of '0' will apply no compression. A value of '1' will cause a signals amplitude to be held down to the threshold value. With values over '1', the signal will become quieter as it passes the threshold.\n",

Instead, they will simply be clipped as they proceed to the output device. The limiter allows you to stop your audio from being clipped if you exceed this range, and applies a much smoother form of fast compression, which is barely audible.\n",

This will determine how long the limiter takes to transition out of a limiting situation. Increasing the release will help smooth out the effect of the limiter. Too high of a value may cause the limiter to release too slowly. For example, after an excessively loud tone burst, the limiter's gain may have been pushed up to an extreme value. This extreme value will take a long time to be fully released.\n",

      "# Audio Oscillator CHOP\n",
      "\n",
      "The Audio Oscillator CHOP generates sounds in three ways. It repeats common waveforms (sine, triangle), it generates white noise (a random number for each sample), or it repeats a prepared incoming audio clip of any duration. It outputs typically 44100 samples per second. In contrast, the [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html \"LFO CHOP\") by default generates waves at lower frequencies and lower sample rates (60 samples/second), however both Audio Oscillator and LFO are interchangeable by changing their frequencies and sample rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, the Audio Oscillator CHOP steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Pitch Control input. By default, a Pitch Control of 0 gives a middle A at 440 Hz; a 1 gives 880 Hz; a -1 gives 220 Hz. Steps of 1 in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart. Steps of 1/12 (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Audio Oscillator is roughly modelled after the [APR 2600 voltage-controlled oscillator](https://www.google.com/search?q=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design&oq=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design) (VCO).\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to three input CHOPs can be connected to the Audio Oscillator CHOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Pitch Control** - The first (optional) input affects the pitch. Output channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. When pitch control is 0, it outputs a wave at the base frequency (default 440 Hz at 44,100 samples per second). It is \"logarithmic\": By default, increasing the pitch control by 1 increases the pitch by 1 octave, by 2 it increases by 2 octaves (4 times the frequency).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reset Pulse** - The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. 0 in the input means \"play the oscillator\". 1 means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback Source\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**Playback Source** - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. The waveform Type and the Base Frequency parameters are disabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you plug any sound clip into the Audio Oscillator CHOP's Playback Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of 0 of any duration, it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html \"Wave CHOP\") as its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the input.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Audio Oscillator CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. 0 pitch is normal speed, 1 is double speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Wave CHOP, this is an iterating CHOP, that is, it steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this effect, feed an LFO CHOP into the Audio Oscillator. Unlike the LFO CHOP, the Audio Oscillator CHOP is designed for audio frequencies.\n",

When converting a signal to its spectrum, two channels are created from the one containing the audio signal. One channel contains the magnitude of the frequency components, and the other contains the phase. The channels are named, for example `chan1_m` and `chan1_p` where `_m` and `_p` are the suffixes for the magnitude and phase channels.\n",

      "**Tip**: You can reduce cook time if you decrease the FFT Size from its default 8192 samples. The fastest form of this CHOP is by setting the Output Length parameter to \"Output Length Manually\". For example set the output buffer size to 2048 samples and the FFT Size to 2048. Each time it cooks, the CHOP is looking at the latest 2028 samples (at 44.1 KHz that amounts to the 50 msec, or 3 frames), which is plenty. Note the default form of the CHOP gives you 22,000 samples: 1 Hz to 22,050 Hz in steps of 1 Hz (when set to Frequency vs Logarithmic scaling), designed for clear interpretation: sample 1000 is the level of audio at 1000 Hz.\n",

Knowing that audio at 44100 samples per second with a timeline frame rate of 60 frames per second gives 735 samples per frame, if the CHOP cooks 1 frame later and the FFT size is 1024, then it will re-use 1024-735 = 289 samples, which is good as there's a little overlap.

To ensure an exact count, click on the Read Basis button to read the original knot sequence into this field.\n",

      "\n",
      "Sometimes a Bias of 0 or 1 does not clamp the knot cluster to the closest neighbouring knot.

These devices naturally output a radial scan from the device as the center point, where each point represents (angle, distance).

This method will automatically be used if **only** the first input is connected. SimpleBlobDetector has the benefit of not requiring a known background to detect blobs but only returns blobs as a position and radius, meaning that all blobs rectangles will be square. The SimpleBlobDetector can also be quite slow so lowering the input resolution is often necessary. Generally this method should only be used if the background is not known.\n",

Background subtraction is less dynamic and requires a known background to function but it offers a massive performance improvement over SimpleBlobDetector, and unlike with SimpleBlobDetector the blob rectangles using this method are not restricted to squares only. The background subtraction method will create a binary image from the first and second input (based off the threshold parameter) and then use OpenCV to find contours and convert those to rectangles.\n",

      "The bloom starts with a **preprocessing stage** (Pre-Black Level, Pre-Gamma, and Pre-Brightness), (similar to the Black Level, Brightness, and Gamma parameters of a [Level TOP](Level_TOP.html \"Level TOP\")) which help to isolate the hot spots of the image that the bloom originates from (the Black Level), and boost the hot spots (Gamma and Brightness). (Switch the Output menu for a moment to Pre-Process to make sure you have a good signal to bloom with.)\n",

      "The **second stage is a combination of scaled-down (blurred) levels** of the pre-processed image: The first level is the original pre-processed image, the second level is scaled down to half size (essentially 4 pixels averaged into one pixel), the third is the second level scaled down to half, and so on until the \"top\" level is 1x1 pixel (the average of the whole image.) For example, a 1024 x 1024 input images gives 10 levels. (These are called mipmaps.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The second stage blends a range of scaled-down blur levels using the Min Bloom Radius and Max Bloom Radius parameters, where 0 refers to the first scaled-down level and 1 refers to the top scaled-down level. The Min and Max determine how dispersed or smeared the blooming is. Note: If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.\n",

It also has some extra features such as length, two types of geometry, end-to-end linking, and kinematic parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bone Component is used to create hierarchies of limb-like objects that form part of a hierarchy or chain of Bone Components that are parented to one another. The movement of the chain of Bone Components is \"solved\" or computed based on several methods including Inverse Kinematics. The parenting attribute of bones is unique in that each bone attaches to the end, not the origin, of the parent bone.\n",

      "It is recommended that you use the Bone Creation state, accessed through the state icons above the Viewport, to construct such a chain because placing individual Bone Components and establishing their parenting relationships from operator to operator is extremely time consuming and not at all intuitive. In addition, a chain created using the Bone state will produce a better behaved bone chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, bones do not render. They contain two types of display geometry: \"link geometry\" and \"capture region geometry\". The former consists of a narrow diamond shape which has been stretched to the length specified in *Bone Length*, and placed along the Bone Component's negative Z-axis. The latter consists of two or more user-controllable ellipses that are used to define capture regions used in skeleton sops. You can specify whether either of the two types of geometry are displayed.\n",

This type of locking motion tends to make characters look robotic. The dampening field is a number between zero and one. The larger the number, the greater the dampening effect. Dampening is applied to the entire bone chain as the chain approaches its full extension. The end affector is thus allowed to drift off the end of the bone chain.

      "\n",
      "Linear Multiplier `linmult` - ⊞ - A multiplier for the linear velocities of the actors in the simulation. For example, if linmult is (0, 1, 1) then the actors can move linearly at normal speed on the Y and Z axes but cannot move in the X direction. These values are multiplied internally by the values from dimension. For example, if the dimension is 2D and linmult is (0, 1, 1) then the only direction the actors can move is along the Y axis because 2D is constraining on the Z and this parameter is constraining on the Y.\n",

So, if dimension is 2D and angmult is (1, 0, 0) then the actor will not be able to rotate in any direction because 2D constrains rotation only to the Z axis, and this parameter is constraining it only to the X axis.\n",

      "Initialize Sim and Collision Shapes `initall` - Resets all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity) and recreates their collision shapes. This parameter is equivalent to pulsing each Actor COMP's \"Initialize Actor\". Creating collision shapes can be time consuming in certain cases, so if it's not need then Initialize Sim should be used instead. Collision shapes need to be recreated if any of the SOPs used to create the collision shape change, or if the instancing OP changes.\n",
      "Initialize Sim `init` - Reset all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity). This will not begin stepping through the simulation, it will only initialize. **NOTE:** This will not reset the collision shapes of any Actor COMPs, \"Initialize Sim and Collision Shapes\" above or \"Initialize Actor\" on the Actor COMP should be used for that.\n",
      "Start Sim `start` - Initialize the simulation and run it (begin stepping).\n",

      "Simulation Speed `simspeed` - The speed of the simulation. It is a multiplier for the size of the timestep to slow down or speed up the simulation.\n",
      "Feedback CHOP `feedback` - (see also: [Bullet Solver CHOP](Bullet_Solver_CHOP.html \"Bullet Solver CHOP\")) A reference to a CHOP to feedback. The Bullet Solver COMP will take the transform/velocity channels from the CHOP and override the respective actor's transform or velocity at the beginning of the next simulation step.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you feedback a Bullet Solver CHOP that has no change to the channel values in it, the simulation will act as normal as nothing is being overriden. This allows you do things like the example below.\n",
      "For example, to negate the velocity of every actor in a simulation you could use a Bullet Solver CHOP, put that into a Switch CHOP with the second input being the same CHOP only with the velocity channels negated. Then export a button pulse to the switch index and put the Switch CHOP into the Feedback CHOP parameter. Then, when the button is pressed for a single frame (pulsed) the velocities will be overridden and negated.\n",
      "The only channels required to feedback are the actor\\_id and body\\_id channels, all other channels are optional. The channel names should all be the same as in the Bullet Solver CHOP. In addition to the channels outputted in the Bullet Solver CHOP, force and torque can also be used. The channel names are **force[xyz]** and **torque[xyz]**. **NOTE:** scale cannot be used for feedback.\n",

      "Perform Contact Test `contacttest` - Enables contact testing for all bodies in the simulation. Contact testing is used for the colliding and total\\_collisions channels on the Bullet Solver CHOP. Without this parameter enabled those channel values will not update. **NOTE:** Contact testing can be slow for lots of bodies.\n",
      "Always Simulate `alwayssim` - When enabled the Bullet Solver COMP will simulate (ie. cook) every frame.\n",

The available callbacks are: `onCollision(solverComp, collisions)`, `onFrameStart(solverComp)`, `onFrameEnd(solverComp)`, `onInit(solverComp)`, `onStart(solverComp)`. A DAT with these callbacks will be automatically created and referenced when a Bullet Solver COMP is created. `onCollision(solverComp, collisions)` passes a list of all collisions occuring, and requires that Perform Contact test be enabled. `collisions` is a list of named tuples (`bodyA` and `bodyB`). `bodyA` and `bodyB` are the two bodies participating in the collision. `bodyA` and `bodyB` are Python Body Objects (see [Body Class](Body_Class.html \"Body Class\")).\n",

Each CHOP has an Export flag (and an Export Prefix, infrequently used), causing the CHOP to connect its channels to Components, SOPs, TOPs and so on. The Export flag and Export Prefix can also use automatic matching of channels names to find export destinations. For example, a CHOP \"tx\" channel could map to an Geometry Component's tx parameter.

The default FPS for TouchDesigner is 60, and with FPS of 60, there will always be 60 frames per second. A CHOP range can start at any frame number (or second), and end at any later frame number. A frame will always correspond to a certain time expressed in seconds. Precisely, seconds is `(frame-1)/FPS`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sample index may have no relation to time or frame, as when a CHOP is used as lookup table. But when \"index\" is tied to time, the CHOP's samples per second (sample rate), determines how many samples per second there are, and even how many samples per frame. Some CHOPs default to 60 samples per second, which is 1 sample per frame. But CHOPs can be created or resampled to any sample rate, so a CHOP's sample rate of 240 samples per second gives 4 samples per frame, and audio at 24,000 samples per second is 400 samples per frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if a CHOP is shifted in time to start at a frame number like 301 (10 seconds), its sample index always starts at 0. Its `op('wave1').sampleIndex` is 0 at its first sample.\n",

      "**NOTE**: Set the \"frames per second\" of the timeline for the project via the bottom of the timeline, or in Python `project.cookRate = 120`, for example.

Numerous CHOPs like the [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html \"Pattern CHOP\"), [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html \"Math CHOP\") and [Delay CHOP](Delay_CHOP.html \"Delay CHOP\") have extra local members that allow the customization of each channel: The Python object for the operator has a `.chanIndex` member. For example, if the Pattern CHOP generates three channels you can put something like `[3, 4, 5][me.chanIndex]` in the Amplitude parameter to customize its value for each channel. The first channel will be evaluated with an Amplitude value 3, the second channel with a value of 5, etc. Search `me.chanIndex` in the wiki.

      "CHOP channels will automatically be exported if the channel name can resolve to the path:parameter in the file. '`:`' and/or '`/`' are used as separators for the paths and parameter. For example a channel named `geo1:tx`, will get exported to a node named `geo1`, parameter `tx`, if it exists. The node is searched for starting at the node that the **Export Root** parameter refers to. Usually the Export Root is left as default, which is '`parent()`' in python. This means \"start searching at my parent\". So for the above example, the CHOP will need to be in the same network as `geo1` for the export to work. The channel names can contain paths, such as `container1/geo1:tx`. which will search for `container1/geo1` (relative to the Export Root), parameter `tx`. You can use `/` and `:` in the channel names interchangeably for this feature, however a good convention to follow is use `name1/name2` for the path to the node, followed by a `:` to separate the node from the parameter name.\n",

You can not individually disconnect channels from this method of exporting, its all channels or none.

For example, when the Data Format is RGB and the there are 9 input channels (for example, r0 g0 b0 r1 g1 b1 r2 g2 b2), there will be 3 rows of pixels using the default image layout.\n",

      "If the Image Layout parameter is set to Fit to Square, the TOP determines the image resolution based on the total number of samples across all channel sets (approximately the square root of the number of samples + 1) in width and height. This layout is most often used for point cloud data, where an efficient layout is preferred and the position of a pixel is not generally important. Unlike in the wrapped layout, channel sets in this mode are appended immediately to the end of the previous set, so that any empty pixels will appear at the end of the image. Where there are some unused pixels, you can fill the unused pixels at the top with a special value based on the Extra Pixel Values parameter, (0, 0, 0, 0) by default. To put (0, 0, 0, -1) you have to set the pixel format to 32-bit float so you can represent negative and positive numbers of any value.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Clay SOP deforms faces and surfaces by pulling points that lie directly on them. As opposed to the Point SOP or other SOPs that manipulate control points (CVs), the Clay SOP operates on the primitive contours themselves, providing a direct, intuitive, and unconstrained way of reshaping geometry. Thus, rather than translating CVs to change the aspect of the primitive, the Clay SOP takes the inverse approach of manipulating the primitive's skin to reposition the CVs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point that defines the area to be modified is called a \"target point\" or \"target\" for short. It is expressed as a (u,v) pair in the parametric space of the primitive and ranges between 0 and 1 in both U and V. The image of the target point on the primitive is a 3D point which Clay can displace in several ways. Furthermore, if the primitive is a surface, there is are options to pull only the point or a whole isoparametric curve in either U or V.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clay does not refine the faces and surfaces unless asked to, so the complexity of the geometry does not increase. The area affected by the change varies with each primitive type and topology. In all cases it is possible to reduce to amount of change by inserting a Refine SOP before the Clay SOP and inserting detail around the target point. For other ways to increase the locality of the deformation as well as its sharpness, see U and V Sharpness below.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a second input is present, it is possible to snap the target (u,v) point to an (s,t) point on the first primitive of the second input. Without a second input, the primitives can be made to snap to themselves. Moreover, the Clay SOP is able to snap the target to arbitrary points in space.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both this SOP and the Align SOP can be used effectively as snapping tools and building blocks for curve networks. The main difference between the two SOPs is that Clay deforms the inputs partially, while Align translates and/or rotates the whole primitive.\n",

All the transformations are exclusive, and all reduce to a signed translation along a direction. The difference between the various transformations is the way the translation and the direction are specified.\n",

Any primitive type is allowed, including metaballs, all quadrics, and even particle systems. The point on the destination primitive is expressed parametrically as a (U, V) pair.\n",
      "\n",

Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the object.\n",

      "For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an object is located at: `-1, -1, 0` and you wanted to scale the object by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%) the object would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.\n",

If the inputs are surfaces and U is off, clay will pull the surfaces along the entire V direction (if V is on) or not at all.\n",

For surfaces, U defines a line of constant value in the parametric space of the primitive and requires a second coordinate - V - to specify a unique location (see the V> Page below). Spline faces and surfaces have explicit parametric spaces known as domains; since domains are not restricted to the unit range [0, 1], the Clay SOP maps U to the real domain value of the primitive. For polygons and meshes, U is expressed in terms of the number or vertices and columns respectively and in terms of their relative positions.\n",

Since clay affects the CVs in the neighbourhood of the given parametric location, the bias can influence the amount of pull applied to the CVs on either side of this location. The effect is a slant of the \"wave\" the parametric point rides on - towards one side or the other.\n",

The pull generated by clay on these primitives can be smooth or sharp depending on the position of the target relative to the underlying domain (the farther away from a knot, the rounded the bulge) and the knot multiplicity near the target (the higher the multiplicity the sharper the pull). If the pull is too round or affects too big an area in U, the U Sharpness parameter can reduce it by inserting one or more knots at the target U value. When the U Sharpness is zero no knots are inserted. When the U Sharpness is 1, all \"degree\" knots are inserted and the shape becomes very sharp. The U Sharpness varies in discrete steps; the number of steps equals the U degree of the spline.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** The range of the U Sharpness slider varies with the degree of the spline (i.e. the closer it is to 1, the more knots it adds). Since the number of knots added forms a discrete sequence, the slider will automatically jump to the valid positions.\n",

      "Deform along V `vwarp` - Determines whether the clay operation affects the V parametric direction of the surface. If the inputs are surfaces and V if off, clay will pull the surfaces along the entire U direction (if U is on) or not at all. If both U and V are on, clay will pull the surface at the target (U, V) point specified in the U and V folders below. This option does not affect face types.\n",
      "V `v` - This value affects only surface types. V defines a line of constant value in the parametric space of the surface and together with U specifies a unique location in that space. Spline surfaces have explicit parametric spaces known as domains; since domains are not restricted to the unit range [0, 1], the Clay SOP maps V to the real domain value of the surface. For meshes, V is expressed in terms of the number or rows and their relative positions.\n",
      "V Bias `vusebias` - Indicates whether the clay algorithm should use the bias it thinks works best for the given V parameter, or take the value explicitly stated beside the toggle. Since clay affects the CVs in the neighbourhood of the given parametric location, the bias can influence the amount of pull applied to the CVs on either side of this location.

      "A Constraint COMP is used to restrict the movement of the bodies in a set of [Actor COMPs](Actor_COMP.html \"Actor COMP\"). Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint COMP. Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.\n",

It is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two parameters.

      "External .tox `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.\n",
      "Reload .tox on Start `reloadtoxonstart` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.\n",
      "Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Custom_Parameters \"Custom Parameters\") are reloaded when the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox \".tox\") is reloaded.

This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.\n",
      "Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.\n",
      "Re-Init Network `reinitnet` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present), followed by re-initializing itself from its master, if it's a clone.\n",

      "See [Write a CPlusPlus Plugin](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_CPlusPlus_Plugin \"Write a CPlusPlus Plugin\") and the other articles in the [C++ category](Category_C%2b%2b.html \"Category:C++\") for more detailed information on how to make .dll for use with this SOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The C++ code can be written for GPU or CPU loading. The ease of developing C++ code for either of these two options are fairly similar. Nevertheless, by setting the “`directToGPU`” flag within the C++ code, only one of these modes is recognized as a valid mode. Different classes are dedicated for each of these two modes, so bear in mind that setting the “`directToGPU`” flag to “`true`” or “`false`” requires different classes and functions to be called within either of `execute()` or `executeVBO()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In CPU mode, the geometry data can be added one at a time or all at once. As well, in CPU mode the CPlusPlus SOP can use wired SOP inputs and SOP to DAT, SOP to CHOP, or SOP output OPs as well. Additionally DAT, CHOP, and TOP 'non-wired' input operators can be used as custom parameters. In this case, the custom parameters must be first handled in the C++ code to be able to accept any input from the other operators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The GPU direct mode is similar to CPU mode, but it cannot use any output SOPs downstream or be accessed by SOP to DAT or SOP to CHOP operators. In GPU direct mode the data is added to the VBO buffers immediately which improves the performance through faster updating, however the size of the vertices and face array indices must be known prior to filling the buffers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example for CPlusPlus SOP as a Visual Studio project in Windows are available in `C:/Program Files/Derivative/TouchDesigner/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP` or your custom TouchDesigner installation folder. (NOTE: On macOS it is here: `TouchDesigner.app/Contents/Resources/tfs/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP`)\n",

      "\n",
      "**Geometry Data** - Geometry within the C++ SOP code can be defined by any algorithm or even imported from external files. The possible geometries are triangular meshes and particle systems. Note that if your original geometry has polygons with more than 3 vertices, they must be converted to triangles with known and valid vertex indices, before being added to the list of triangles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The geometry data for exporting to TouchDesigner can have point, normal, and texture coordinates, RGBA colors, triangle information in case of meshes and/or particle systems, as well as custom attributes with an arbitrary name, float or integer type, and up to 4 components (ie. Cd0, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3).\n",

      "Examples include: 0.5 1.2-3.9 5.\\*\n",

      "Divisions on Face `divs` - The number of points to evaluate on the proles or the faces. This SOP works by using a straight line approximation of the given curve to deform the surface. Thus, more segments are slower, but the result looks better. Fewer divisions need to be specified when deforming proles and when the rest and deforming faces have an equal number of breakpoints.\n",
      "Sharpness `sharp` - Species the area around the face to deform. The larger the sharpness is, the smaller the deformation area around them (thus having a sharper pull on the surface).\n",
      "Refinement `refine` - Usually, CurveClay automatically renes the surface. However, you may specify some degree of renement control. In general, the more rened the surface is, the smoother the result. Better renement results in a denser surface. You should experiment with values between -1 and 1. When the value is negative, the SOP will rst rene the surface to the same detail level as when renement is 0, and then it unrenes it. The lower the value, the more unrened it becomes.\n",

If the red and blue are .5, .5, then Uo = Ui and Vo = Vi. That is, there is no warp if the Displace Image is a 50% grey. Also the warp is reduced to 0 if the Displace Weight is 0. Where red < .5 in the Displace Image, it fetches a pixel from the left of Uo in the Source Image. If blue < .5, it fetches a pixel from below Vo in the Source Image. Thus the pixel is retrieved from Ui, Vi at Uo\\*Scale\\*(red-.5), Vo\\*Scale\\*(.5-blue) of the Source Image.\n",

      "EtherDream is a laser controller. The EtherDream CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to an [EtherDream](http://ether-dream.com/) device via a network connection. The EtherDream device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the EtherDream CHOP. Applications of the EtherDream CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.\n",

Such details can be seen by connecting the EtherDream CHOP to an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html \"Info CHOP\"), and may be useful for troubleshooting display images.\n",

      "The `maxrate` column of the EtherDream DAT indicates the maximum number of samples per second that can be sent to the EtherDream device, though in practice, most lasers are reflected into position by a set of mechanical reflectors, with their own mechanical characteristics. As a result, attempting to quickly scan a square over a large area too quickly, for example, may result in a very curved corners as the physical components lag behind their target positions.\n",

      "\n",
      "Offsets - This SOP can be used for generating two offsetting curves where the distance between the two curves remains constant. To do this, make sure that you set Side Mesh to No Output, the first thickness to zero and adjust the second to increase or decrease the distance of the offset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fixing Stray Normals - If your geometry contains normals that are pointed in many directions (say after reading geometry from a [File In SOP](File_In_SOP.html \"File In SOP\"), or if you have a lot of open or non-planar polygons), you can fix it so that they are suitable for extrusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do this by appending a [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html \"Group SOP\") to the SOP that contains your geometry, enable Normal, and reduce the Spread Angle to something less than 180. Then append a [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html \"Primitive SOP\"), which should work on the group made in the Group SOP. In the Face/Hull page, set the Vertex menu to Reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the normals in your geometry will all be oriented in the roughly the same direction, and ready for extrusion. To narrow the tolerance, decrease the Spread Angle further.\n",

Upon reloading a `.toe` file, the assets can be imported directly from the \"`.tdc`\" cache, and the FBX file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing \"`.tdc`\" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the FBX file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new \"`.tdc`\" will be saved out.\n",

      "1) Specify a valid file path in the \"FBX File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct `.fbx` extension.\n",

      "2) This step is varied depending on whether the FBX COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Import\" button to generate the FBX network and import the assets. Note that we recommend changing the \"Import Method\" to to other modes (less work) can significantly improve performance.

If they're external then they may be exported with an absolute path to the texture file, which means if you move the FBX file to a different machine or relocate the file, then the textures will fail to load.

      "The one Euro Filter is especially useful when a person is in an interaction loop with TouchDeigner and wants quick response: It responds quickly to large changes in value, and it smooths out jitters in the input:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cutoff Frequency: Decrease it if slow speed jitter is a problem.\n",
      "* Slope Cutoff Frequency: Avoids high derivative bursts caused by jitter. (The research paper implementation fixes this value to 1Hz but defaults to )\n",
      "* Speed Coefficient: Increase if high speed lag is a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1 € filter (\"one Euro filter\") is a simple algorithm to filter noisy signals for high precision and responsiveness. It uses a first order low-pass filter with an adaptive cutoff frequency: at low speeds, a low cutoff stabilizes the signal by reducing jitter, but as speed increases, the cutoff is increased to reduce lag. The algorithm is easy to implement, uses very few resources, and with two easily understood parameters, it is easy to tune. In a comparison with other filters, the 1 € filter has less lag using a reference amount of jitter reduction. (researchgate.net)\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a procedure to tune the One Euro filter:\n",
      "First Speed Coefficient is set to 0 and Cutoff Frequency to a reasonable middle-ground value such as 1 Hz. Then the body part is held steady or moved at a very low speed while Slope Cutoff Frequency is adjusted to remove jitter and preserve an acceptable lag during these slow movements (decreasing Slope Cutoff Frequency reduces jitter but increases lag, Slope Cutoff Frequency must be > 0). Next, the body part is moved quickly in different directions while Speed Coefficient is increased with a focus on minimizing lag. First find the right order of magnitude to tune Speed Coefficient, which depends on the kind of data you manipulate and their units: do not hesitate to start with values like 0.001 or 0.0001. You can first multiply and divide Speed Coefficient by factor 10 until you notice an effect on latency when moving quickly. Note that parameters Speed Coefficient and Speed Coefficient have clear conceptual relationships: if high speed lag is a problem, increase Speed Coefficient. If slow speed jitter is a problem, decrease Slope Cutoff Frequency.\n",

      "Type `type` - ⊞ - There are seven types of filters:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Gaussian `gauss` - This filter has a Gaussian (normal or \"bell\" curve) shape that smooths the channel. It acts as a low pass filter. The wider the filter, the lower the cutoff frequency, resulting in smoother data.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Left Half Gaussian `halfgauss` - This produces a lag on the channel. If the input channels represent values over time, this filter is seen as only using samples back in time from the current sample. For time-data, this is more realistic as you can't look ahead in time. (Maybe some day.) It has a half-bell shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Box `box` - This filter is box-shaped, meaning that each neighbor sample it uses has the same weighting factor. It can produce unwanted steps in the output channel because the effect of the samples at the extremes of the filter don't fade out as the window slides over the samples. It low-pass filters data, similar to the Gaussian filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: When using Gaussian or Box filtering, the channel is delayed by half the filter size (i.e. a Filter Size of 30 samples will delay the output by 15 samples). To eliminate this delay, use either a Left Half Gaussian or a Left Half Box filter. Applying a Sharpen or Edge Detect filter always delays the output by half the filter size. Applying a Despike filter will delay the output by the full filter size.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Left Half Box `halfbox` - This filter produces a lag on the data, uses only samples back in time, and otherwise acts like a box filter.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Edge Detect `edge` - This filter detects \"edges\", sharp changes in the input channels. It acts as a high pass filter. As the filter width is increased, more low frequencies are added.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sharpen `sharpen` - This filter sharpens all high frequencies. It is the sum of the edge detect result and the original data.\n",
      "\n",
      "* De-spike `despike` - This filter removes \"spikes\" (samples more than `Spike Tolerance' above or below the expected sample value). The filter width allows you to eliminate spikes that are several samples long. Wide filters will remove wide spikes (spikes of several samples) and small filters will only remove narrow spikes (one or two samples in length).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Ramp Preserve `ramp` - This filter attempts to output an increasing ramp that increases at the 'Ramp Rate' parameter rate. The input channel to the Filter CHOP should be increasing at this rate, with possibly some errors/noise in it. The Ramp Preserve will ignore the input channel unless the difference between the input value and the current ramp value is larger than 'Ramp Tolerance' parameter. When the difference becomes greater than the tolerance, the ramp will reset to start at the current input value.\n",
      "\n",
      "* One Euro `oneeuro` - This filter is good for filtering noisy signals while maintaining high precision and resposiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Effect `effect` - The extent to which the filter affects the channel (0 - not at all, 1 - maximum effect).\n",
      "Filter Width `width` - The amount of surrounding samples used in the calculation of the current sample. It is expressed in the Units.\n",
      "Filter Width Unit `widthunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.\n",
      "Spike Tolerance `spike` - For the De-spike filter type, this is the amount that a sample can differ from its neighbours without being considered a spike.\n",
      "Ramp Tolerance `ramptolerance` - When using a Ramp Preserve filter, if the input value deviates from the current output ramp value by this much, then the ramp will reset to the new input value. Otherwise the Ramp Preserve will continue climbing at the specified 'Ramp Rate'.\n",
      "Ramp Rate `ramprate` - When using a Ramp Preserve filter, this is the rate that the CHOP's output channel will increase. Only if the input channel value deviates from the desired output value by 'Ramp Tolerance' amount will the CHOP instead output the input channel value.\n",
      "Number of Passes `passes` - The number of times the filter is applied to the channel.\n",
      "Filter per Sample `filterpersample` - Applies the filter to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.\n",
      "Cutoff Frequency (Hz) `cutoff` - Decrease it if slow speed jitter is a problem.\n",
      "Speed Coefficient `speedcoeff` - Increase if high speed lag is a problem.\n",
      "Slope Cutoff Frequency (Hz) `slopecutoff` - Avoids high derivative bursts caused by jitter.\n",
      "Reset `reset` - When On resets (bypasses) the filter effect.\n",
      "Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets the filter effect.\n",

      "U Order `orderu` - If the input is a face, this is the order of the Spline curve to be generated. If the input is a surface, this is the order of the fitted spline surface in the U parametric direction.\n",
      "V Order `orderv` - If the input is a surface, this is the order of the fitted Spline surface in the V parametric direction. The V order is irrelevant if the input is a face.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Parameters - Approximation Page\n",
      "\n",
      "Approximation fitting is used primarily to generate a lean, smooth shape from a dense data set. The result is a primitive that approximates the positions and attributes of the data points but does not necessarily touch these points. The only points the fitted curve or surface goes through are the end-points of the data set. If the fitted primitive is required to go through all the points, fitting by interpolation is the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The approximation fit is capable of producing very reasonable shapes with far fewer control vertices than the number of data points. Although the result is unlikely to match the original shape identically, it can come very close to it, depending on the parameters it is set to. For this reason, approximation fitting is often used as a data reduction tool and performs best when the size of the data set is large.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fitted primitives are generated open or wrapped based on the \"open\" property of the inputs. For best results, the input primitives should be open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolerance `tol` - This is the primary precision factor in approximation fitting. The smaller the tolerance, the closer the fit and the higher the number of generated vertices. If a small tolerance causes unwanted twists or contortions in the fitted primitive, it may help to vary the Spline order and/or enable the Multiple Knots flag.\n",
      "Smoothness `smooth` - For a set tolerance, the smoothness factor allows for more or less roundness in the generated shape. If this parameter is zero, it does not mean that the fit will be sharp. It simply indicates that no additional smoothing is required past the level of smoothness already achieved with the given tolerance.\n",
      "U Multiple Knots `multipleu` - Sometimes the data set has sharp bends that must be preserved in the fitted shape. In this case, inserting multiple knots in the areas of sharp curvature will usually produce the right effect. Sometimes, however, the simulated sharpness induces unwanted twists immediately before or after the corner. Lowering the Spline order and/or reducing the tolerance may help diminish this side-effect.\n",
      "V Multiple Knots `multiplev` - Sometimes the data set has sharp bends that must be preserved in the fitted shape. In this case, inserting multiple knots in the areas of sharp curvature will usually produce the right effect. Sometimes, however, the simulated sharpness induces unwanted twists immediately before or after the corner. Lowering the Spline order and/or reducing the tolerance may help diminish this side-effect.\n",

      "## Parameters - Interpolation Page\n",
      "\n",
      "Interpolation fitting is used primarily to generate a shape that goes through (i.e. interpolates) a complete set of data points and their attributes. As opposed to approximation fitting, interpolation thrives on small data sets. Moreover, unlike the approximation method, this one does not produce a leaner structure than the input it fits. In certain cases it even generates a higher CV count than its input. For this reason, the use of interpolation fitting should be limited to those cases where point interpolation is paramount, such as building precise animation paths.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Local (Curves Only) `local` - Local interpolation takes a more geometric approach, building the curve or surface one span at a time, using only local data at each step. The local method generates more CVs than the number of data points it is given, but it usually yields a tighter fit than the global method. The local approach is also less computationally expensive than the global one, and handles cusps and local perturbations better. Local interpolation is available only for curves.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Breakpoints `breakpnt` - Breakpoint interpolation is a variant of global interpolation that satisfies the requirement that the locations of data points coincide with the breakpoints of the generated curve. The breakpoints of a Spline curve are the image of the Spline basis on the curve. Breakpoint interpolation is available only for curves.\n",
      "\n",
      "U Data Parameter `dataparmu` - ⊞ - Specifies the parameterization of the data in the U direction (the only direction if the input is a curve). The data parameterization can be uniform, chord length, or centripetal.\n",
      "Uniform Uniform parameterization uses equally spaced parameter values. It works best when the geometry is very regular. When the data is unevenly spaced, this approach can produce very unintuitive shapes, and is not recommended.\n",
      "Chord Length Chord length computes the parameterization of the data based on the relative distances between successive data points. It is the most commonly used approach because is tends to produce the most accurate results.\n",
      "Centripetal Centripetal parameterization is similar to chord length, but yields better results when the data has very sharp corners.\n",

[Bullet](Bullet_Dynamics.html \"Bullet Dynamics\") supports linear/rotational forces and impulse forces (see Force page) and [Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex \"Flex\") supports force fields (see Force Field page).\n",

      "### Active Force\n",
      "\n",
      "Active forces are enabled using the Active toggle parameter on the Force page.\n",
      "\n",
      "An active force will create a force in the simulation that is applied over time. An active force can either be applied globally by being referenced on the [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html \"Bullet Solver COMP\"), or it can be applied locally by being referenced on an individual [Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html \"Actor COMP\"). The active force applies its force each frame, and the force applied over 1 second is equivalent to an impulse force of the same value applied in a single frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "The units for the force and torque parameters are in Newtons (N), equivalent to kg\\*m/s^2. This means that if a force of 10N is applied to an actor with mass equal to 5kg and no initial velocity, then after 1 second the velocity of that actor will be 2m/s => 10N / 5kg \\* 1 sec = 2m/s. If all the parameters were the same, but instead it was an impulse force, then the velocity would still be 2m/s. However, the impulse force's velocity would change instantaneously and stop increasing (unless pulsed again) whereas with the active force the velocity will continue to increase after 1 second.\n",
      "\n",
      "The center of mass is assumed to be center of the bounding box of the mass. By default, if a body is not constrained and not colliding, the force will not cause the body to rotate, unless the Relative Position parameter is set to a non-zero value. If Relative Position is set to +1 in X and the force is +1 in Y, it will cause the body to rotate counter-clockwise around the Z-axis and translate in Y.\n",

      "Impulse forces are applied through the Impulse Force pulse parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "An impulse force pulse will create a force in the simulation that is applied for 1 frame. In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in [Bullet](Bullet_Dynamics.html \"Bullet Dynamics\") this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as an active force with the same values if the active force is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of impulse force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg \\* 1sec = 2m/s.\n",

Smoothness and Scale have a similar effect, but there is a subtle difference. Smoothness is calculated for each iteration of the SOP. The number of Iterations is, in turn set by the number of Divisions. Scale, by contrast, is a global scaling of the amplitude of the deviations, with no consideration of the stage at which they are created. Using low values of smoothness (producing large deviations) and a small scale value will give a slightly more random looking result than doing the opposite; high roughness values (small deviations) and large scale values, providing Divisions is greater than 1.\n",

So -20dB means 1/10 the amplitude, and 6dB is double the amplitude.\n",

      "The Geo Text COMP renders text in 3D. It does not read or generate a SOP as it does direct rendering using the [Slug Library](Slug_Library.html \"Slug Library\") and can be lit and textured with any [MAT](MAT.html \"MAT\") material.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can set fonts, colors, sizes, bold, italic, tracking, multi-lines like you can with the [Text COMP](Text_COMP.html \"Text COMP\"). But because the Geo Text COMP doesn't have a boundary, width or height like the Text COMP, we substitute it with a layout box and the Layout Box parameters. The layout box has a width and height, and by default the bottom left of the layout box is placed at 0,0,0 in 3D space of the Geo Text COMP (\"object space\"). The Layout Box Anchor U and V let you put the center of the layout box at 0,0,0 by setting the anchors to .5, 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The layout box's size although you can't see it by default, is the Layout Box Size parameter. With that you can right-justify or top-justify text in the layout box, and clip to the layout box. You can also pad space aroud each side of the layout box.\n",
      "\n",
      "See also the 2D equivalent [Text COMP](Text_COMP.html \"Text COMP\"). See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes \"Text Formatting Codes\") for ways to override settings per-character.\n",

      "\n",
      "Most columns override a Geo Text COMP parameter, such as `text`, `tx` and `fontsize`. Some column names noted below have no corresponding parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Spec CHOP can also specify values per block. When including a Spec CHOP the number of Spec CHOP samples needs to be the same number of rows as the Spec DAT following the first column header.\n",

      "Parameters that can be overrided include `fontsize`, `fontcolor`, tracking etc., plus all the layout box and alignment parameters. Font/bold/italic are supported as columns as they are separate fonts.\n",

      "**Transforming text blocks**: The column or channel names can include `tx`, `ty`, `tz` and all the rotate and scale channels (which use the Transform Order parameter).\n",

      "Local transforms (`ltx`, `lrz`, etc), can be used to apply additional transforms to a block that are not inherited by appended blocks. If the special column/channel `localxform` is set to '`pre`', then the local transform is applied in world space before the inherited transforms are applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note** - The Geo Text COMP uses **blending/transparency** to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the [Draw Priority](#Parameters_-_Render_Page) parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. **Note**: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.\n",

      "Specification DAT `specdat` - In this mode, the Text parameter is ignored and data is taken from a DAT table given in the Specification DAT parameter. Each row of the DAT is a separate line of text, which can have different transforms, alignment, color, word wrap settings applied to them. The column headers should match the parameter name which the column is overriding. If a column entry for a particular row is left empty, then the value of the parameter is used instead. This allows a default value to be used for all rows, but allowing select rows to have different settings as needed. Transforms are not overridden, any transform that is given is applied as a pre-transform before the other transforms given by the parameters. Valid columns are currently: `text, tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz, sx, sy, sz, px, py, pz, ltx, lty, ltz, lrx, lry, lrz, lsx, lsy, lsz, lpx, lpy, lpz, fontcolorr, fontcolorg, fontcolorb, fontalpha, alignx, aligny, alignymode, fontsize, tracking, skew, horzstretch, linespacing, wordwrap, layoutsizew, layoutsizeh, layoutanchoru, layoutanchorv, textpaddingl, textpaddingr, textpaddingb, textpaddingt, render, append, localxform`.\n",

      "Sort by Depth `sorted` - Only available when using a Specification DAT. When enabled, lines in the specification DAT are rendered from back to front relative to the current camera to allow for proper alpha blending. Note: sorting a large number of text blocks can cause performance issues, so this should only be enabled if regular alpha blending is not sufficient.\n",
      "Formatting Codes `formatcodes` - Enables the use of formatting codes in the text. For example, the code {#color(255, 0, 0);} will turn all text afterwards on that line red. See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes \"Text Formatting Codes\") for all available codes.\n",
      "Parse Escape Sequences `escapeseq` - When enabled, '\\t' sequences will be converted to tabs and '\\r' or '\\n' to line breaks. This feature is only enabled when using the Specification DAT. For Text mode, python expressions should be used when escape sequences are needed.\n",
      "Smart Punctuation `smartpunct` - Enables the use of smart punctuation. For example, pairs of quotes will be replaced with appropriate angled quotes, 3 periods will be replaced with an ellipses character and two hypens will become an em-dash.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Hokuyo CHOP will work with all serial or ethernet Hokuyo laser scanners, though the only laser scanners tested in-house are the URG-04LX-UG01 (Serial) and the UST-10LX (Ethernet).\n",

      "It can be used with the [Blob Track CHOP](Blob_Track_CHOP.html \"Blob Track CHOP\") to detect objects in its field. See the Snippet for Blob Track.\n",

      "All of a computer's available serial ports can be found in the Device Manager under the Windows operating system. Their names begin with 'COM'. Example: COM1, COM2, COM3, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hokuyo CHOP outputs the measurement data from the laser scan in meters, either in Polar or Cartesian Coordinates. The laser scan is done counter clockwise over N degrees (defined by the device, eg. URG-04LX-UG01 is 240 degrees, UST-10LX is 270 degrees) and returns the distance to the first object hit by the laser at that point.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hokuyo laser scanners have an angular resolution that specifies the number of data points returned from a full scan. For the URG-04LX-UG01 there is a data point every ~0.3515 degrees, so over a 240 degree scan there is a total of 682 data points. For the UST-10LX there is a data point every 0.25 degrees, so over a 270 degree scan there is a total of 1080 data points. The Hokuyo laser scanners also have a start and end step that define a total detection range.\n",

      "The UST-10LX has the same measurement parameters as the UTM-30LX in the chart below. The UST-20LX ethernet model will also work like the UST-10LX.\n",

      "If the Hokuyo device is an ethernet model like the UTM-30LX-EW, make sure Window Firewall is not blocking it. Each install of TD will need to be allowed through the firewall separately. This commonly catches people out with networking OPs, as sometimes the Windows “allow TD to network” dialog doesn’t open on first connection attempt. A quick disabling of the firewall will let you test this theory.\n",

For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Join SOP connects a sequence of faces or surfaces into a single primitive that inherits their attributes. Faces of different types can be joined together, and so can surfaces. Mixed face-surface types are not allowed. The surfaces do not have to have the same number of rows or columns in the side being joined. Spline types of different orders and parameterization are all valid inputs. The Join SOP converts simpler primitives such as polygons into Bziers and NURBS if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joining is different from filleting (see [Fillet SOP](Fillet_SOP.html \"Fillet SOP\")) or stitching (see [Stitch SOP](Stitch_SOP.html \"Stitch SOP\")) because it takes n primitives and converts them into one after possibly changing the connected ends of the primitives. Filleting creates a new primitive between each input pair and never affects the original shapes. Stitching changes the original shapes but does not change the number of resulting primitives.\n",
      "\n",

      "Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html \"Pattern Matching\").\n",
      "Blend `blend` - Determines the way the primitives are joined. A blended face or surface will typically reposition the ends to be joined and convert them into a single, common point, row or column respectively. The amount of change can be reduced or eliminated by lowering the tolerance (see Tolerance below). When not blended, the original shapes remain unaffected. Instead, the chosen ends are joined by an arc-like fillet. In either case, the result is a single primitive.\n",
      "Tolerance `tolerance` - The meaning of the tolerance varies with the type of join. The shapes of blended primitives will change less if the tolerance is low. If the tolerance is < `1`, a new point, knot, row or column is inserted between the last and before-last point, row or column. The lower the tolerance, the closer the insertion to the ends being pulled together, and thus the smaller the region affected. When the tolerance is zero the blended inputs do not change at all: the faces are connected by a straight line and the surfaces by a flatish, linear patch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tolerance also affects the size and roundness of the fillet built between non-blended primitives. A zero tolerance yields a short, flat fillet; a unit tolerance generates pointed, non self-intersected fillet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bias `bias` - Affects only blended primitives by varying the position of the common point, row or column linearly between the two original ends. If the bias is zero, the common part will coincide with the end of the second primitive and the end of the first primitive will be stretched all the way to it. If the bias is one, the common part will coincide with the end of the first primitive and the second primitive will be stretched.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bias is irrelevant when the blend tolerance is 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiplicity `knotmult` - Affects the number of knots inserted at the blend point and thus allows for smooth or pointed connections. The connection will be pointed when the Multiplicity is on. When Blend is not on, an active multiplicity influences the shape and the tightness of the fillet by forcing a multiple knot insertion when on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fillet tends to be better behaved when multiplicity in on. However, this means that the resulting face or surface is built with a discontinuity at the connection points and might not lend itself to point modeling in that area too well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiplicity has no effect on polygons and meshes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Connect Closest Ends `proximity` - The Join SOP connects the tail of the first primitive with the head on the next primitive, and so on unless this toggle is on, in which case the closest ends are chosen instead. For surfaces, this option enables the proximity test in U or V, as specified in the Direction parameter below.\n",
      "Direction `dir` - ⊞ - This menu determines the parametric direction of the joining operation, which can be in U or in V, and is meaningful only when the inputs are surfaces. The U direction is associated with columns; the V direction refers to rows. For example, joining two surfaces in U will generate a surface with more columns than either input. The number of rows might be higher too, but only if the two inputs have a different number of rows or a different V basis.\n",

      "Wrap Last to First `loop` - If enabled, it connects the beginning of the first primitive to the end of the last primitive, thus forming a single, closed face or hull. If a single, open primitive exists in the input, it will be closed. The [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html \"Primitive SOP\") provides a more direct way of closing primitives but offers almost no shape controls.\n",

      "Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field causes the SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html \"Pattern Matching\").\n",
      "Divisions `divs` - Allows you to specify the number of circles between each pair of input circles.\n",
      "Preserve First Input `preserve1` - Preserves the first input circle being fed into the SOP.\n",
      "Preserve Last Input `preserve2` - Preserves the last input circle.\n",
      "Orient Circles `orient` - This helps to create a joint that blends between the input circles without flattening or curving outwards. In order to do this, there may be a reversal of the normal of each input circle. For example, if the normals of the two input circles are facing away from each other, the joint created (if this option was not enabled) would appear to connect the circles the long way around. This option would reorient the joint such that the shorter distance is used to create the joint.\n",
      "Smooth Path `smoothpath` - If not on, the joint circles are blended linearly. Otherwise, they are placed along a cubic piece-wise Bzier curve between the circle centres. This is useful when the input contains more than two circles and the joints must be continuous to each other. If this option isn't enabled, the interpolation may be sharper than desired.\n",
      "Smooth Twist `smoothtwist` - Each joint circle is rotated slightly such that its X and Y axis align as it approaches an input circle. This toggle causes the adjustments to be an incremental, or piece-wise, Bzier function. Again this is useful for multi-circle inputs.\n",
      "Align Major Axes `majoraxes` - If enabled, this option aligns the first circle's largest axis to the last circle's largest axis. If disabled, the first and last circles' x axes are aligned. This option can help minimize the twist in the joint ellipses between bones.\n",
      "Minimum Twist `mintwist` - If on, the rotations of the added circles are calculated such that they never rotate further than one half turn in either direction. This leads to a visually continuous layout suitable for creating a skeleton, but will cause problems if the circles are later skinned since the beginnings of each circle may no longer be continuously aligned.\n",
      "LR Scale `lrscale` - ⊞ - These parameters control the shape of the smooth path, varying the shape of the implied curve from the left or right. If the Orient Circles option is on, the sign of the scale has no effect. For a discussion of the relative terms right and left, see [Align SOP](Align_SOP.html \"Align SOP\").\n",

The Laser CHOP gives optimal control over the movement of the reflectors of the laser projector as well as enhanced color control.

      "\n",
      "This SOP has very few buttons and looks simple, but it is important to understand how it works. The first input, called **Geometry to Deform**, is for the geometry you wish to deform. The second input, called **Rest Geometry**, must be an evenly spaced grid which fully encloses the geometry to deform. The third input, called **Deformed Geometry**, is a copy of the initial grid that is altered in some way, either by moving parts of it with animation channels, dragging its points in the Model Editor, or by running it through a [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html \"Spring SOP\") which distorts it with the forces which simulate the laws of physics. Lattice computes a deformation based on the difference between the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry, and applies it to the input geometry. The output of the SOP is the deformation of the geometry in the input source. If the Deformed Geometry is being animated, the output will also bend, twist and stretch every frame.\n",

      "# LFO CHOP\n",
      "\n",
      "The LFO CHOP (low frequency oscillator) generates waves in real-time in two ways. It synthesizes curves using a choice of common waveforms like Sine or Pulse, or it repeats a prepared incoming curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "It steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Frequency parameter and the Octave Control input. To watch its behavior, attach a Trail CHOP to its output and alter the Frequency parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up to three input CHOPs can be connected to the LFO CHOP:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Octave Control** - Without this first (optional) input, the frequency is simply the Frequency parameter. If this input is connected, every unit doubles the frequency: When Octave Control is 1, the frequency is double, when it is 2 it is 4x, when it is -1 the frequency is half the Frequency parameter and when it is 0, there is no change in the frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Reset** - The seond (optional) input contains on-off (<=0 or >0) that restarts the channels of the oscillator from the beginning of the wave. The reset depends on the setting of the Reset Condition menu. By default, when the Reset input goes from off to on, it resets the wave and starts the waveform immediately. If Reset Condition is set to \"While On\", the reset value will be held until the Reset input goes off. Reset means \"stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform\".\n",
      "\n",
      "**Source Wave** - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a multi-sample CHOP curve and can contain any number of channels, limited to the channels defined on the Channel page. The waveform Type parameter is disabled.\n",

      "The LFO CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you alter the Frequency, you can control the time warp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html \"Wave CHOP\"), this is a time-sliced CHOP, that is, it generates its waveform as it goes, and speeds/slows how it steps through the waveform Type while the Frequency changes.

Metaballs can be thought of as spherical force fields whose surface is an implicit function defined at any point where the density of the force field equals a certain threshold. Because the density of the force field can be increased by the proximity of other metaball force fields, metaballs have the unique property that they change their shape to adapt and fuse with surrounding metaballs. This makes them very effective for modeling organic surfaces. For example, below we have a metaball. The surface of the metaball exists whenever the density of the metaball's field reaches a certain threshold:\n",

      "\n",
      "The MIDI Out CHOP sends [MIDI](MIDI.html \"MIDI\") events to any available MIDI devices when its input channels change. More flexibly, the Python [midioutCHOP Class](MidioutCHOP_Class.html \"MidioutCHOP Class\") can be used to send any type of MIDI event to a MIDI device via an existing MIDI Out CHOP. In [Tscript](Tscript.html \"Tscript\"), the `midi` command can output MIDI events.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MIDI devices can be other software programs (such as midisynth) or devices attached to the serial ports. Channels are used to control the sending of the MIDI events. The channels are evaluated over the last time slice (from the last [Timeline](Timeline.html \"Timeline\") position to the current).\n",
      "\n",
      "The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events based on any changes to its input channels. The channels have to be named appropriately, like `ch3c14` and `ch7n60`.\n",
      "\n",
      "An event is sent every time a channel changes its value during this slice. All timing is preserved, as long as the [Timeline](Timeline.html \"Timeline\") is running in realtime (the \"Realtime\" flag is in the top menu bar).\n",
      "\n",
      "Naming the CHOP channels: Channels are mapped to events by their name. Events like notes, controllers and velocities must be followed by the note/controller number (n65, c7). If the number is left off a note event, the note number is the value of the channel. Other events, which are sent to the entire channel, do not need a trailing number (pc, pw). The channel prefix can be used to identify the MIDI channel the event should be sent on (i.e. \"ch1n45\" assigns that TouchDesigner channel to note 45 messages on MIDI channel 1). Channels can always be renamed with a [Rename CHOP](Rename_CHOP.html \"Rename CHOP\") before entering the MIDI Out CHOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI velocity as well. The values of the channels entering the MIDI Out CHOPs are sent as the velocity of the note. If Normalize is \"None\", the channel needs to be 0 to 127. If Normalize is \"0 to 1\", channel values between 0 and 1 are scaled to be MIDI 0 to 127.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Cook Every Frame\" option cooks the CHOP every frame, even if the CHOP isn't being displayed. All Volume Off and All Volume On flags are new and emit events for Controller 7 of all 16 channels. MIDI output go in a separate thread to allow output that slows TouchDesigner less. It now works in Time Slice mode for note events and controller events. (Not for Program Change or Sysex messages yet) Note channels only trigger anew Note On when the input channel goes from 0 or less to a value greater than zero. Similar for Note Off events.The channel name determines how it is interpreted.\n",

      "ch5n - This channel will contain note numbers.¬† The value quantized to an integer, and when the integer value changes, the note of the old value goes off and the note of the new value goes on. If the channel steps from 53 to 78, it sends a Note Off event for note 53, and a Note On event for note 78.\n",
      "ch14c7 - the value of the channel is sent to controller 7 (volume) of channel 14. By default, the values 0 to 1 are mapped to MIDI value 0 to 127.\n",
      "\n",
      "These features work in Time Slice mode:\n",
      "\n",
      "By default, channels are to start with \"ch\" followed by the channel number (1-16). In the case of notes, it is followed by \"n\" for notes, then digits for the note number. In the case of controllers, it is followed by \"c\" and a controller number. These prefixes can be altered. MIDI Out now interprets aftertouch, pressure, pitchwheel channels, and outputs these events to the MIDI stream. Note-normalization is added allowing 0 to 127 and 0 to 1 ranges. MIDI Out reads a bar ramp channel to output MIDI clock events¬† (with a channel popup menu to the parameter to select the channel name).

If the file still isn't opened the next time the TOP cooks, it'll wait again, and do the same. It'll keep doing this until the file is opened, or the open fails.\n",
      "On Timeout, use Latest Avail `uselatestontimeout` - When on, if the Disk Read Timeout is reached TouchDesigner will use the latest available frame in place of the skipped frame.\n",
      "Async Upload to GPU `asyncupload` - When enabled, this will use OpenGL features to upload movie images to the GPU asynchronously. This will reduce the cook time of the Movie File In TOP considerably (in the performance monitor the lines that say \"Uploading Image to GPU\" will go down to almost nothing). There is a GPU memory cost to using this feature however. It uses up another (Width \\* Height \\* 4 \\* Read Ahead Size) bytes of GPU memory. If you are having poor results with this feature, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.\n",
      "Update Image `updateimage` - Image will not update when set to 0. Movie index will continue to move forward but the output image will not update. This is useful when you are using a Movie Audio CHOP to get audio from the movie, but you don't care about the video.\n",
      "Max Decode CPUs `maxdecodecpus` - Limit the maximum number of CPUs that will be used to decode certain video codecs that are capable of multi-CPU decoding, such as H264/H265 and Cineform. Note that this does not affect multi-threaded decoding for image sequence playback, which is instead controlled by increasing the Pre-Read Frame parameter.\n",
      "High Performance Read `highperfread` - This option should be used when playing back files that require very high SSD read speeds such as high resolution (4K+) HAP Q files. It greatly improves read performance in those cases. It should not be used for low resolution or low data rate files such as 1080p H264 files.\n",
      "High Performance Read Factor `highperfreadfactor` - When doing high performance reads, this parameter controls the size of the read operations that are done on disk. Whatever the largest operation the codec asks to be done, this is multiplied by the read factor and all subsequent reads will read that much data instead. This can result in higher throughput depending on the drives. For example if a request is made to read 1MB and the factor is set to 3, then instead the operations will read 3MB from the disk and the extra 2MB read will be ready for the next frame and will likely already have the next 2 frames available in CPU RAM.\n",
      "Hardware Decode `hwdecode` - Controls if this node should use hardware decoding via the Nvidia hardware decoder chip. You can check if hardware decoding is being used using the Info CHOP, 'hardware\\_decode' channel. This parameter does nothing for Hap and NotchLC codecs, which are always hardware decoded.\n",

      "Failover Source Name `failovername` - If this source fails while receivers are connected to it, they will instead try to connect to the specified Failover Source. This format of this should be `MACHINENAME (SourceName)`. This format is the same as you would see the source listed in the NDI In TOP.\n",
      "FPS `fps` - Specify the frame rate to send at. Note that NDI uses the FPS partially as a guide to control how to compress the frames. The higher the FPS, the more compressed the frames will be. So for example sending at 1 FPS will result in higher image quality that sending at 30 FPS.\n",

      "Type `type` - ⊞ - The noise function used to generate noise. The functions available are:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Sparse `sparse` - Produces high quality, continuous noise based on Sparse Convolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Hermite `hermite` - Quicker than Sparse, but produces lower quality noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Harmomic Summation `harmonic` - Sparse noise with the ability to control the frequency step of the harmonics. Slowest type.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Brownian `brownian` - Works like a bug in random flight. With Num of Integrals at 2, its acceleration is changed randomly every frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Random `random` - (White Noise) Every sample is random and unrelated to any other sample. It is the same as \"white noise\" in audio.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Alligator `alligator` - Cell Noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seed `seed` - Any number, integer or non-integer, which starts the random number generator. Each number gives completely different noise patterns, but with similar characteristics.\n",
      "Period `period` - The approximate separation between peaks of a noise cycle. It is expressed in Units. Increasing the period stretches the noise pattern out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Period is the opposite of frequency. If the period is 2 seconds, the base frequency is 0.5 cycles per second, or 0.5Hz for short. Hz refers to Hertz, the electrical and audio engineer of the 19th century, not the car guy.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the Type is set to Random, setting this to zero will produce completely random noise. Otherwise, the period should be greater than zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Period Unit `periodunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, Seconds, or Fraction.\n",
      "Harmonics `harmon` - The number of higher frequency components to layer on top of the base frequency. The higher this number, the bumpier the noise will be (as long as roughness is not set to zero). 0 harmonics give the base shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harmonics with a base frequency of 0.1Hz will by default produce harmonics at 0.2Hz, 0.4Hz, 0.8Hz, etc. (up to the number of harmonics specified by the Harmonics parameter).\n",
      "\n",
      "Harmonic Spread `spread` - The factor by which the frequency of the harmonics are increased. It is normally 2. A spread of 3 and a base frequency of 0.1Hz will produce harmonics at 0.3Hz, 0.9Hz, 2.7Hz, etc. This parameter is only valid for the Harmonic Summation type.\n",
      "Roughness `rough` - Controls the effect of the higher frequency noise. When roughness is zero, all harmonics above the base frequency have no effect. At one, all harmonics are equal in amplitude to the base frequency. When roughness is between one and zero, the amplitude of higher harmonics drops off exponentially from the base frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default roughness is 0.5. This means the amplitude of the first harmonic is 0.5 of the base frequency, the second is 0.25, the third is 0.125. The harmonics are added to the base to give the final shape. The Harmonics parameter and the Roughness parameter must both be non-zero to see the harmonic effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exponent `exp` - Pushes the noise values toward 0, or +1 and -1. (It raises the value to the power of the exponent.) Exponents greater than one will pull the channel toward zero, and powers less than one will pull peaks towards +1 and -1. It is used to reshape the channels.\n",
      "Num of Integrals `numint` - Defines the number of times to integrate (see the Area CHOP p. 114) the Brownian noise. Higher values produce smoother curves with fewer features. Values beyond 4 produce somewhat identical curves. This parameter is only valid for the Random noise type.\n",
      "Amplitude `amp` - Defines the noise value's amplitude (a scale on the values output).\n",
      "Reset `reset` - Only available if operator's `Time Slice` Parameter is on. Toggling this parameter will reset the noise calculation and hold the value until the parameter is released again.\n",
      "Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Only available if operator's `Time Slice` Parameter is on. Pulsing this parameter will reset the noise calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Translate, Rotate, Scale and Pivot parameters let you sample in a different part of the 3D noise space. Imagine a different noise value for every XYZ point in space. Normally, the Noise CHOP samples the noise space from (0,0,0) along the X-axis in steps of 2/period. `/tx /ty /tz /rx /ry /rx /sx /sy /sz /px /py /pz`\n",
      "\n",
      "By changing the transform, you are translating, rotating and scaling the line along which the Noise CHOPs samples the noise space. A slight Y-rotation is like walking in a straight path in the mountains, recording your altitude along the way, then re-starting from the same initial location, walking in a slightly different direction. Your altitude starts off being similar but then diverges.Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T \\* R \\* S \\* Position\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz \\* Ry \\* Rx\n",
      "\n",
      "Translate `t` - ⊞ - XYZ translation values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rotate `r` - ⊞ - XYZ rotation, in degrees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scale `s` - ⊞ - XYZ scale to shrink or enlarge the transform.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pivot `p` - ⊞ - XYZ pivot to apply the above operations around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Constraint `constraint` - ⊞ - Constraint and its parameters allows the noise curve to start and/or end at selected values. The mean value may also be enforced. **Note:** This only works when Time Slice is Off because time slicing has no pre-determined start/end.\n",
      "\n",
      "* None `none` - No constraints set.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Start Value `start` - Sets the noise starting position to the value set in 'Starting Value' parameter below.\n",
      "\n",
      "* End Value `end` - Sets the noise ending position to the value set in 'Ending Value' parameter below.\n",

      "Starting Value `constrstart` - Value for the starting position.\n",
      "Ending Value `constrend` - Value for the ending position.\n",
      "Mean Value `constrmean` - Value for the mean value of the noise.\n",
      "Normalize `normal` - Ensures that all noise curves fall between -1 and 1. Applied before the Amplitude parameter. Only valid for Random and Harmonic Summation noise types, since Hermite and Sparse noise are always normalized. Normalizing random noise occurs between integrations, producing a more controlled curve. **Note:** This only works when Time Slice is Off because time slicing has no pre-determined start/end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Channel Names `channelname` - You can creates many channels with simple patterns like \"`chan[1-20]`\", which generates 20 channels from chan1 to chan20. See the section, Common CHOP Parameters for a description of this and all Options. See [Scope and Channel Name Matching](CHOP_Common_Page.html#Scope \"CHOP Common Page\") Options. Each channel has a unique seed, so all channels will be different with the same parameter settings.\n",

      "**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  \n",
      "**Hardware:** This TOP uses the AI Green Screening module from the [Nvidia Maxine Video Effects](https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine) engine and requires a 20, 30 or 40 series Nvidia RTX card to operate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nvidia Background TOP performs AI image segmentation to separate a person from the background of a given image. Unlike the [RGB Key TOP](RGB_Key_TOP.html \"RGB Key TOP\") or the [Chroma Key TOP](Chroma_Key_TOP.html \"Chroma Key TOP\"), the background top uses AI to identify the foreground and background portions of the image and does not require a solid background color. However, the AI model is trained to look for specific image patterns (a person in front of a webcam) and may not perform as well on generic input as the key TOPS. The output of the node is a monochrome key image where white pixels indicate the foreground person and black pixels represent the background. Commonly, this key image is used to replace the background of the source image using the [Matte TOP](Matte_TOP.html \"Matte TOP\") or other compositing nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the time it takes to run the AI model, the output of the Background TOP will be multiple frames behind the original image when processing a video input. For accurate compositing you will want to match the output key image with the original frame that was used to produce it. An easy way to do this is to use a [Cache TOP](Cache_TOP.html \"Cache TOP\") with the Output Index set to a negative number of frames. When placed between the source video and the compositor input, this will delay the source image so that it synchronizes with the key image.\n",

      "Tip: The AI model is tuned for a single person sitting in front of a webcam. Videos including full body images, multiple people or indirect camera angles may not perform well.\n",

      "\n",
      "The OAK Device CHOP serves as the main interface to an OAK camera. It also implements many of the features of the Timer CHOP such as timer counters, pulses, and custom Python callbacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "Before starting TouchDesigner, connect any OAK Devices to the computer via USB or Power over Ethernet (PoE). If you connect any devices while TouchDesigner is running, you should pulse the Refresh Device List parameter on the OAK Device CHOP. Next, customize the Python createPipeline callback and pulse the start parameter to start the camera. It's ok if you save a project while a camera is running. The camera will know to automatically start when the project opens next time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Resolution and ISP Scale\n",
      "\n",
      "The `depthai` python module has an enum for RGB resolution: [dai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/references/python/?highlight=dai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution#depthai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution). This enum currently includes THE\\_1080\\_P, THE\\_1200\\_P, THE\\_4\\_K, and many others. These options may not necessarily be compatible with your OAK hardware. The most commonly available RGB resolution is 1080p. You can save on bandwidth by selecting a lower resolution via the ISP scale. Selecting (2, 3) with THE\\_1080\\_P will result in a 1280x720 image.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Configs\n",
      "\n",
      "The DepthaiTestSuite.toe project includes several base components which help control settings of an OAK camera by sending messages via an OAK Device CHOP. For example, the oakDeviceConfig base enables the user to set the XLinkChunkSize, logging level, and infrared laser settings of a device. The oakCameraControl base helps control RGB camera settings. The oakStereoDepthConfig base helps control stereo depth settings. It is possible to use these configs while the camera is running.\n",

      "### Optimizing Latency and FPS\n",
      "\n",
      "Luxonis has a tutorial on [low latency](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/tutorials/low-latency/). In some cases such as streaming 4K video, you'll want to set [XLinkChunkSize](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/references/python/?highlight=xlinkchunksize#depthai.GlobalProperties.xlinkChunkSize:~:text=disables%20consistent%20timesyncing-,setXLinkChunkSize,-(self%3A) to zero. This can be done with the oakDeviceConfig.\n",
      "\n",
      "When creating `depthai` pipelines, it's possible to set FPS targets for various nodes such as the [ColorCamera](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/color_camera/) node. In general, the FPS cannot be changed after the pipeline has been loaded on the camera. You should pick high FPS values, but keep in mind that if you push these numbers too high, you may see the effective FPS as shown by an Info CHOP begin to fall.\n",

      "The Queue Size parameter helps TouchDesigner avoid holding onto too many messages while also re-using memory for a minimum number of messages. For example, picking 2 is a good choice because TouchDesigner can show 1 message to the user while 1 remaining message can asynchronously be written to with new data. However, if the stream is meant to be high frame-rate, such as [IMU](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/imu_data/) data, then the queue size should be at least double the number of messages you expect to receive in a single TouchDesigner frame. If TouchDesigner were to drop a video frame, then the next cook would want to use two times the number of messages that would have normally be shown, requiring the queue size to be at least twice as large.\n",

For example, [ImgDetections](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/) can be grouped into item0's channels, item1's channels, item2's channels and so on. For these kinds of streams, it can be helpful to have a constant number of channels in the OAK Select CHOP, regardless of whether an item exists in the most recent message.\n",

      "The default Output Format is \"Items as Separate Channels\". For example, when receiving [ImgDetections](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/) from MobileNet, each detection would require 6 channels (\"confidence\", \"label\", \"xmin\", \"xmax\", \"ymin\", \"ymax\"). The total number of channels would be 6 times the **Max Items** built-in parameter. In this situation, time-slicing is enabled, so the number of samples will vary according to time-slicing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're willing to sacrifice time-slicing, you can set the output format to \"Items as Separate Samples\". This will shuffle the latest messages into 6 channels by **Max Items** samples. In other words, each ImgDetection item will correspond to a CHOP sample. Another reason to use \"Items as Separate Samples\" is if you're implementing a callback such as `onReceiveNNData` and need to set the number of samples (`oakSelectOp.numSamples = 1`).\n",

      "The OAK Device CHOP has several callback methods copied from the Timer CHOP class. These are `onInitialize`, `onReady`, `onStart`, `whileRunning`, and `onDone`. One new callback is `onInitializeFail` which is called whenever the body of `onInitialize` raises an error. The more important new callback is `createPipeline(oakDeviceOp): -> dai.Pipeline`. This method must return a [depthai.Pipeline](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/pipeline/). If you browse the examples from the Luxonis documentation, there is often a function called `create_pipeline`, which you can sometimes copy with few modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "When starting a camera with the OAK Device CHOP, the order of events is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The built-in parameters for \"initialize\" or \"start\" are pulsed.\n",
      "2. The `onInitialize(oakDeviceOp, callbackCount)` method is called with callbackCount set to 1. The user-defined code should return a non-negative integer. Returning a positive number will result in waiting that many frames until `onInitialize` is called again. Note that `onInitialize` is a good place to download any files that might be necessary for the pipeline. Several of the TouchDesigner OAK examples demonstrate this by downloading neural network files asynchronously with the **blobConverter** and **fileDownloader** components.\n",
      "3. Once `onInitialize` returns zero, the `createPipeline` method is called, and the user-defined code must return a pipeline. Note that it's not yet possible to interact with the `depthai.Device` instance in this callback because the Device hasn't been created yet. Such interactions would have to wait until the `onReady` or `whileRunning` callbacks.\n",
      "4. The `onReady` method is called. This indicates that the pipeline has been loaded on the OAK device and the device has communicated to TouchDesigner that it's running. Note that it is not a guarantee that all streams are working or have been received, but in most circumstances it means that data is about to be received. At this point any OAK Select CHOPs and TOPs that are set to active and have correctly named Stream Names will begin to receive data.\n",
      "5. Once the built-in parameter for \"start\" is pulsed, the `onStart` method will be called, and the timer-related functionality of the OAK Device CHOP will proceed.\n",
      "6. While the device is running, for every frame the `whileRunning` method will be called.\n",
      "7. If \"gotodone\" parameter is pulsed while the device is running, the `onDone` callback will be called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that you can restart the timer functionality by pulsing the start parameter of a camera that is already running. The pipeline will not be recreated and loaded on the camera. So if you need to create a new pipeline (possibly with different settings), then you should pulse the initialize parameter one more time.\n",

      "Transform Order `xord` - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your Component will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as `translate * rotate * scale * vectorOrPosition`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Translate / Rotation / Scale `t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz]` - The three fields allow you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the Component in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.\n",

Once you have designated this Component to look at, it will continue to face that Component, even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another Component's movements. The Look At parameter points the Component in question at the other Component's origin.\n",

Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.\n",

      "Production Tip: For Smooth Motion Along a Path - Having a Component follow an animation path is simple. However, when using a NURBS curve as your path, you might notice that the Component speeds up and slows down unexpectedly as it travels along the path. This is usually because the CVs are spaced unevenly. In such a case, use the [Resample SOP](Resample_SOP.html \"Resample SOP\") to redistribute the CVs so that they are evenly spaced along the curve. A caution however - using a Resample SOP can be slow if you have an animating path curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "An alternative method is to append a [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html \"Basis SOP\") to the path curve and change it to a `Uniform Curve`. This way, your Component will move uniformly down the curve, and there is no need for the Resample SOP and the unnecessary points it generates.\n",

      "\n",
      "Position `pos` - This parameter lets you specify the Position of the Component along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from `0` to `1`, where `0` equals the starting point and `1` equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as `10` for multiple \"passes\" along the path.\n",

      "# OP Find DAT\n",
      "\n",
      "The OP Find DAT traverses the component hierarchy starting at one component and looking at all nodes within that component, and outputs a table with one row per node that matches criteria the user chooses. For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with “`wave`”, or all nodes with the Clone parameter set to “`master1`”, or all Geometry components with a tag called “`emitter`”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a DAT containing certain strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also cause the DAT to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find DAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback DAT.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an \"or\" or \"and\" on the pattern matching criterea.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also takes an optional DAT containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find DAT) which can be used to chain filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Output Columns\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a variety of columns that you can select from including `name`, `id`, `paths`, `type` and `tags`. (`id` is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback DAT, and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback DAT. For example, you can output a custom column which is the `tx` parameter value of the node.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can control when the OP Find DAT cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active Cook menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely. You can also click the Pulse parameter on Active Cook in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find DAT can take an input DAT containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input DAT should contain the node “id” as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find DAT with the Column called “ID” turned on.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or Clone parameter. The first OP Find DAT pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.\n",

OSC In can be used to accept messages from either a 3rd party application which adheres to the Open Sound Control specification (<http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/>). OSC In is based on a connection-less system, meaning that it can accept multiple messages for any number of sources at the same time. The user must specify a port number which OSC In will look for incoming messages. This port must not have anything running on it before OSC In attempts to use it. OSC CHOPs in TouchDesigner use the UDP transport protocol.\n",

The name is based on the serial number that is usually printed on the top of the sensor in the format \"os-############\". This name can be entered directly into the Device Address parameter (see parameter help below). You can also connect to the device through a web browser using the IP or name in the format `[http://os-###########/](http://os-/###########/)`. The web interface allows you to check the status of the device and gives additional error information.\n",

Particle systems are often used to create simulations of natural events such as rain and snow, or effects such as fireworks and sparks. In Touch, the points of the input geometry are used as the starting positions of the particles. Each point of the input can be affected by external force (gravity) and wind. Particles can collide and bounce off another object, set by the Collision Source. They can also bounce off, or die at, limit planes set in X, Y and Z.\n",

A point with a Normal of magnitude 1 emit bear particles with a velocity of 1 unit per second in the direction of the normal.\n",

In other words, the first thirty-two seconds have been bypassed, and the time at thirty-three seconds is shifted to frame one. The first thirty-two seconds must still be calculated in order to compute the status of the points, so you will notice some delay upon reset.\n",
      "Time Inc `timeinc` - The Time Inc parameter determines how often to cook the SOP. By default, this parameter is set to `1/me.time.rate`. This means that the SOP will cook once for every frame. When complex dynamics are involved, the SOP may require more frequent cooking for increased mathematical accuracy. To get sub-frame accuracy in the cooking, set the Time Inc to something smaller than `1/me.time.rate`.\n",

      "Alpha Speed `alpha` - As a particle goes faster, it should become more transparent. The Alpha Speed parameter defaults to 0, which doesn't change alpha as the speed increases. A typical value of 0.5 causes the particle to be 70% opaque when it's going 1 unit/second. Increasing the Alpha Speed parameter makes it more transparent at a given speed.

      "\n",
      "The Pattern CHOP generates a sequence of samples in a channel. Unlike the [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html \"Wave CHOP\") its purpose is generating arrays of samples that have no reference to time (seconds or frames).\n",
      "\n",
      "It is useful for curve generation like lookup tables, simple shapes that can be converted to SOPs, generating channels that are passed to the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html \"Geometry COMP\") to generate instances, and other non-time-based curve-generation, with as little need to make expressions in Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "All defaults are in samples, not seconds or frames (though like all CHOPs, it carries with it a sample rate). There is no start-end, just Length in samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip**: To display a CHOP viewer in the units of samples, make the [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html \"Viewer Active\") and change [RMB](Mouse_Click.html \"Mouse Click\") -> Units to be Samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pattern CHOP optionally takes one input CHOP to match the length and sample rate, and, choosing via the Combine Channels menu, Appends or Inserts the new channel(s), Replaces the incoming channels, Adds to the incoming channels or Multiplies the incoming channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pattern CHOP defaults to one cycle of the curve over the length of the CHOP, no matter how many samples long.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip: Customizing each channel:** The python object for the Pattern CHOP has a `chanIndex` member, so if Pattern generates three channels you can put something like `[1, 3, 7][me.chanIndex]` in any parameter to customize its value for each channel. For example, in the Type parameter, put the expression `['sin', 'cos', 'ramp'][me.chanIndex]` to get 3 different curve types.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Phaser CHOP does staggered (time-offset) animation interpolation. Phaser outputs one channel with multi-samples. Each sample animates from 0 to 1 over a cycle, but each sample value rises from 0 and arrives at 1 at different times.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you may have a set of N objects that you want to animate from a start position to an end position. You set Num Samples to N, which will make the Phaser CHOP output one channel with N samples that will animate the samples from 0 to 1 and be interpolated with an easing function. In the Phaser CHOP the start-to-end cycle is controlled by the first input of the CHOP, which is expected to be one channel with value between 0 to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 0-1 values can be used with the [Lookup CHOP](Lookup_CHOP.html \"Lookup CHOP\") to animate groups of channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "By default the timing is staggered uniformly. If you want to stagger their transitions irregularly, you use the second input, a set of values in one CHOP channel (typically N samples) that are between 0 and 1. The phase value specifies the object's timing relationship with the rest of those in the CHOP. A phase value of 1 corresponds to an animated object thats \"ahead of the pack\" (ie. it will start animating before the others). A value of 0 corresponds to an object that is late (ie. it will be the last to start easing/animating). If a phase input is not provided then the phase will simply be i/N where N is the total number of objects (ie. samples), and i is the index of the current sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a notion of an \"Edge\" in the Phaser, which describes the cohesiveness of the group of animated objects and how fast the samples rise. A small value will cause the objects to go through the animation very quickly or at high value, very slowly and in unison with other samples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at David Braun's **[TouchDesigner Summit Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PQW4f34c8)** to see the background of the Phaser CHOP. Its functionality draws heavily from David's research and development in quantitative easing.\n",

There are a few special rules depending on the delimiter style e.g. multiple spaces are merged together, but a comma at the end of a line indicates a blank field afterwards.

The Point File In TOP will read and decode frames of the animation into CPU memory before they are used, this can eliminate pops or stutters in playback that occur from some frames taking too long to decode, other resources accessing the hard drive, or looping. When reading a sequence of files, having more Pre-Read Frames will allow multiple files to be decode at the same time. This allows playback of heavy file formats such as .exr in real-time, assuming the machine has enough CPU cores.\n",
      "Frame Read Timeout `frametimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a frame from the hard drive before giving up. If the Disk Read Timeout time is reached, that frame is simply skipped. This also works for network files that are downloaded via http://.\n",

      "File Open Timeout `opentimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a file to open. If the Disk Open Timout is reached, the Point File In TOP will stop waiting and make its image all black, with a grey square in the bottom right corner. If the file still isn't opened the next time the TOP cooks, it'll wait again, and do the same. It'll keep doing this until the file is opened, or the open fails.\n",
      "Async Upload to GPU `asyncupload` - When enabled, this will use OpenGL features to upload movie images to the GPU asynchronously. This will reduce the cook time of the Movie File In TOP considerably (in the performance monitor the lines that say \"Uploading Image to GPU\" will go down to almost nothing). There is a GPU memory cost to using this feature however. It uses up another (Width \\* Height \\* 4 \\* Read Ahead Size) bytes of GPU memory. If you are having poor results with this feature, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.\n",
      "Update Image `updateimage` - Image will not update when set to 0. Animation index will continue to move forward but the output image will not update.\n",
      "Max Decode CPUs `maxdecodecpus` - Limit the maximum number of CPUs that will be used to decode certain file codecs that are capable of multi-CPU decoding.\n",
      "High Performance Read `highperfread` - This option should be used when playing back files that require very high SSD read speeds. It greatly improves read performance in those cases. It should not be used for low resolution or low data rate files.\n",
      "High Performance Read Factor `highperfreadfactor` - When doing high performance reads, this parameter controls the size of the read operations that are done on disk. Whatever the largest operation the codec asks to be done, this is multiplied by the read factor and all subsequent reads will read that much data instead. This can result in higher throughput depending on the drives. For example if a request is made to read 1MB and the factor is set to 3, then instead the operations will read 3MB from the disk and the extra 2MB read will be ready for the next frame and will likely already have the next 2 frames available in CPU RAM.\n",
      "Hardware Decode `hwdecode` - Controls if this node should use hardware decoding via the Nvidia hardware decoder chip. You can check if hardware decoding is being used using the Info CHOP, 'hardware\\_decode' channel. This parameter does nothing for Hap and NotchLC codecs, which are always hardware decoded.\n",

The non-parametric option will yield a curve whose shape and position in space are identical or very similar to those of the chosen profile.

If Extracted Parametrically (this option checked), the result will extract the profile's parametric image as a 3D face, which will be a planar face in XY whose type (polygon, Bzier, NURBS) will the same as the profile's, and whose vertices match the profile CVs. This, however, does not guarantee spatial coincidence between profile and extracted curve, and is more of an analytical tool.\n",

There are two projection methods: along a vector, or by mapping the face directly onto the parametric space of the surface.\n",

Sequence is not applicable if projecting along a vector.\n",
      "\n",

One spatial curve may generate several profiles depending on its position relative to the surface, the shape of the surface, and the chosen projection side. If the projected face does not intersect the surface at all, no profile curve will be generated.\n",

The resulting projection is sensitive to the parameterization of the surface and is likely to appear distorted. It is, however, the fastest of the two projection types and tends to behave well on surfaces with regular shapes and chord-length parameterizations.\n",

      "\n",
      "* Closest `closest` - Will project the face onto the closest part of the surface in either direction of projection vector. For example, if a curve being projected onto a tube is inside the tube, it will yield two profiles, one on each side of the tube; if the curve is outside the tube, it will project onto the side closest to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Farthest `farthest` - The reverse of Closest. In the example above, Farthest would also yield two images if the curve is inside the tube, but it will choose the farthest side if the curve is outside the tube.\n",
      "\n",
      "Divisions per Span `sdivs` - The number of points to be computed on the spatial face between successive spans. A span is the line connecting two consecutive CVs on a polygon, or the arc between two breakpoints on a spline curve. The projection tends to become more accurate as the number of divisions increases.\n",
      "Ray Tolerance `rtolerance` - Controls the precision of the ray intersection with the surface. The ray is cast along the projection vector from every point of the 3-D curve.\n",
      "Fit Tolerance `ftolerance` - Controls the 2-D fitting precision and is typically less than 0.01.\n",
      "Max UV Gap (%) `uvgap` - This specifies what percentage of the size of the surface domain is acceptable for two separate profiles to be joined into a single curve.\n",
      "Order `order` - The spline order of the resulting profile curve. The type of curve (Bzier or NURBS) is inherited from the spatial curve. The order, however, is not inherited because the spline order provides useful control over the quality of the fit. If the spatial face is a polygon, the profile will be a NURBS curve.\n",
      "Preserve Sharp Corners `csharp` - Controls the precision with which sharp corners in the projection curve are interpolated. It should be on when the projection has areas of high changes in curvature.\n",

      "\n",
      "Map Profile to Range: `userange` - This option is on by default. It causes the profile to be scaled and translated to fit within the surface's domain ranges described below. If this option is off, the profile's coordinates are mapped onto the surface domain without any transformation; consequently, the profile will not be visible if its points are not inside the domain of the target surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typically, the projected face should not be mapped to the U/V range if it was previously extracted from the same surface using the [Profile SOP](Profile_SOP.html \"Profile SOP\") with the Parametrically to XY option selected.\n",
      "The extraction and re-projection tandem can be very useful in achieving the modeling goals currently attainable only with 3D curves. Such tasks include the ability to edit the points of a profile, joining, stitching, or filleting profiles together, carving or refining profiles, etc. By extracting a profile parametrically to XY, Touch creates a 3D face that is identical to the 2D profile but has an additional (constant) Z component.\n",
      "\n",
      "The resulting 3D curve can be modeled using all the 3D tools available. Finally, the modeled 3D face can be reapplied onto the surface parametrically, making sure that the range mapping option is off.\n",

      "Mapping Type `maptype` - ⊞ - Select how to reposition and scale an existing profile to fit within the specified domain range.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Uniform `unif` - Mapping converts the spatial coordinates of the projection faces to (U,V) points in the domain of the surface without taking into account the parameterization of the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Chord Length `chordlen` - Mapping takes into account the surface parameterization and attempts to compute a projection best suited to the spatial and parametric determinants of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the face is not mapped to range, it's vertices will be transferred to the profile without any transformation. Use this technique together with the parametric extraction in the Profile SOP to edit the points of a profile generated by a SOP other than Project: extract, edit the points, then project again.\n",

To unrefine a face or a surface you need to specify a parametric interval (not just a single value as in refinement). This allows you to unrefine primitives within arbitrary intervals, either locally or globally. For example, to unrefine the whole primitive choose 0 and 1 as the two parametric boundaries; [0,0.5] will unrefine only the first parametric half of the primitive.\n",

This parameter enables rendering depth-peels, but without combining all the layers using blending to create order independent transparency. Instead is keeps all the layers separate and they can be retrieved using a [Render Select TOP](Render_Select_TOP.html \"Render Select TOP\"). Depth peeling is done by first rendering rendering geometry normally and saving that image and depth. Then another render is done but the closest pixels that were occluded by the previous pass are written to the color buffer instead. This can be done multiple times, each time peeling back farther into the scene. If you are rendering a sphere the first render will be the outside of the sphere, and the second peel layer will be the back-inside of the sphere.\n",

      "The Speed CHOP converts speed (units per second) to distance (units) over a time range. More generally, you give it a rate (the CHOP input) and it outputs a cumulative value. For example, the Speed CHOP converts rotation rate (rotations per second) into the number of rotation turns. ( Math-heads recognize this as an 'integral', which calculates the area under a curve. The curve is the incoming channel values over a time range, the output is the area.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you send a Constant CHOP channel that has value 1 into the Speed CHOP, then the Speed CHOP output will increase by 1 every second. If you feed it -2, it will decrease by 2 every second, and if you feed it 0, the output will not change. Use a Trail CHOP to see its results. You can reset the Speed CHOP to 0 by pressing the Reset parameter, or by sending in a channel (whose value is greater than 0) into the second input.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first input contains the channels to be 'integrated'. By default, the Speed CHOP is time-sliced, so it keeps adding/subtracting to the output each frame it cooks. If you turn off its Time Slice parameter and send it a CHOP with a fixed frame range (like a default Noise CHOP), you can see the cumulative value starting from 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output is calculated by adding the input's channel values for every sample, divided by the [samples per second](CHOP.html#Parts_of_a_CHOP \"CHOP\") of the Speed CHOP (typically 60), starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative input values reduce the output, positive values increase it. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.\n",

Screen Space Ambient Occlusion is a real-time rendering trick that creates an approximation of ambient occlusion by using the [Depth Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Depth_Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Depth Buffer (page does not exist)\") of the rendered scene. It is done as 2D post-processes, so the complexity of the scene has no bearing on how expensive it is. This is in comparison to true ambient occlusion which becomes more expensive with each new object that is rendered. There are two parts to a SSAO technique. First a SSAO pass is done that determines how much ambient occlusion each pixel is affected by. This result tends to be very noisy. A blur operation is then performed to even out this noise.\n",

Then, points on the newly divided edge are joined with the points on the subdivided boundary. A Bias of `1` will place these joined points along the subdivided boundary. A Bias of `0` will place them along the non- subdivided boundary (and values between 0 and 1 will place them somewhere inbetween).\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulling cracks with the Triangulate option will do exactly the same thing as Divide Edges, except it will also triangulate the non-subdivided polygon. This is desirable because pulling the non-subdivided boundary towards the curved subdivided boundary will likely generate a non-planar polygon, so Triangulate will divide this polygon into smaller (planar) ones. Pulling cracks with a Bias of `1` and triangulating usually produces the nicest results.\n",

      "\n",
      "When Divide Boundary Edges is chosen, the non-subdivided edge is divided, so there are more points available to be used for triangles. The resulting triangles are more regularly shaped (not as long and skinny).

If there is more than one, Sweep will sweep the cross section along each one.\n",

The cross section input can also have multiple primitives, and can be assigned to the backbone in various ways. The origin of the cross section primitive is placed at a point on the backbone by default, but you can also choose a point number of the cross section to place. In most cases, it is best to build 1the cross section primitives in the XY plane; Sweep will automatically orient them properly along the backbone. The orientation of the cross section is based on the direction of the backbone line segment and the positive Z axis. So vertical movement in the backbone will result in the cross section rotating around backbone axis. For example, if you create the cross section in the XY plane, you can maintain its orientation (+Y Up) by building the backbone in the XZ plane.\n",

      "The [Sync In CHOP](Sync_In_CHOP.html \"Sync In CHOP\") and Sync Out CHOP are used to keep timelines in two or more TouchDesigner processes within a single frame of each other. One process will contain a Sync Out CHOP while one or more other processes contain [Sync In CHOPs](Sync_In_CHOP.html \"Sync In CHOP\"). The processes with [Sync In CHOPs](Sync_In_CHOP.html \"Sync In CHOP\") should have their **Realtime flag checked off**, as their frame rates will be determined by the Sync Out CHOP. Also note, all monitors (including all clients and server) should be set to the **same rate**. Note that unplugging or re-adding monitors may sometime change previously configured settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CHOPs synchronize by pausing their own timeline until all Sync In/Out CHOPs have cooked. The Sync Out CHOP will be ahead of the [Sync In CHOPs](Sync_In_CHOP.html \"Sync In CHOP\"). If any CHOPs fail to communicate, the others will timeout, causing all processes to run slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Client machines may come online at any point, or be switched off as desired, as the Sync Out CHOP will adjust accordingly, either timing out, temporarily or permanently banning individual clients as specified.\n",

      "Whenever a client replies, it is immediately assumed reliable, and waited upon, by the Sync Out CHOP each frame thereafter.\n",
      "When a client times-out a number of times in a row, however, it is continuously ignored by the Sync Out CHOP, until it replies on time again.\n",
      "This also applies to clients that have stopped communicating altogether.\n",
      "The number of consecutive timeouts is controlled by the `Client Timeouts (consecutive)` parameter and is reflected by the `timeout_consecutive` [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html \"Info DAT\") column.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever the Sync Out CHOP first starts any and all clients are accepted, and nothing is banned. Pressing `Clear Stats` in the Sync Out CHOP also returns to this state, clearing all banned lists, and totals, even in the remote client [Info CHOPs](Info_CHOP.html \"Info CHOP\").\n",

      "There are **formatting** modes for displaying single-line strings and multi-line text, floating point and integer numbers, password fields and more. The source of the text comes from the Text parameter and it is then formatted for display in the panel. Formatting examples include displaying a number as a currency, percent or scientific notation, or converting an integer timecode value to hours/minutes/seconds/frames. Other formatting options include support for Python syntax, Custom C++ Fmt and Custom Python F-String syntax.\n",

      "You can draw **multiple transformed/formatted strings using a \"Specification DAT\" table**: It draws one string per row of the table, each with its own position and formatting in your panel. Columns can be `x`, `y`, `text`, `fontsize`, `fontcolorr`, `fontcolorg`, `fontcolorb`, `fontalpha`, `skew`, `tracking` and `horzstretch`. You can also use a Specification CHOP for the numeric values of the text attributes.\n",

      "**NOTE:** the following discussing pertains only to face and hull primitives.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a texture type requires fixing of seams and the texture is applied to vertices, the wrapped primitives are unrolled before computing the texture coordinates. Unrolling a wrapped primitive turns it into an open primitive whose new vertices use the same points as the vertices they have been uniqued from. Thus, unrolling does not change the point count, nor does it allow cracks to appear further down the road. Explicit unrolling, using the [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html \"Primitive SOP\"), is not required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The seam fixing is done after computing the texture coordinates. It is required whether textures are applied to vertices or points, and it's done in u, v, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following texture types require fixing of seams:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cylindrical - seams fixed in u.\n",
      "* Polar - seams fixed in u and v.\n",
      "* Row/col - seams fixed in u and v.\n",
      "* Spline types: Uniform, Chord Length, and Average - seams fixed in u and v.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Note:** When the projection type is **Cylindrical** or **Polar**, closed meshes, Bzier & NURBS surfaces will be opened. At least one row/column of vertices will be added (possibly more for NURBS<). This is to prevent poor interpolation of texture coordinates at the seam of the join.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primitive Group `group` - If there are input primitive groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Does not work with point or vertex groups. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html \"Pattern Matching\").\n",
      "\n",
      "## Parameters - Texture Page\n",
      "\n",
      "Texture Layer `texlayer` - If the geometry has multiple textures layers applied to it, this parameter determines which layer of UV coordinates this Texture SOP will effect.\n",
      "Texture Type `type` - ⊞ - The Face, Uniform Spline, and Arc-Length Spline texturing methods accept spline curves as well as polygons.\n",
      "\n",
      "When using one of the spline-based methods, specifying a paste hierarchy in the Group field will propagate the computation of texture coordinates to all of its nodes. Projection methods will typically yield smoother texture continuity between pasted surfaces than any of the spline methods. Sometimes it helps ensuring that pasted features are Chord-length parameterized with the [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html \"Basis SOP\").\n",
      "\n",
      "* Orthographic `texture` - Direct projection from Projection Axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "* XYZ Position `xyzposition` - The XYZ position of the vertices will be copied into the UVW values.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Equirectangular Inside (Spherical Polar) `equirectangularin` - Applies corrdinates to properly apply an equirectangular texture map to the inside of an object. Useful for skyboxes for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Equirectangular Outside (Spherical Polar) `equirectangularout` - Applies corrdinates to properly apply an equirectangular texture map to the outside of an object.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Cylindrical `cylin` - Wrap cylindrically in Projection Axis direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Row & Columns `rowcol` - For geometry constructed as a mesh (Grid, Sphere, Tube, Skin, and Sweep). The U coordinates are placed along rows, and the V coordinates along columns. This is good for texturing curved meshes such as car fenders where you cannot project from any one axis.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Face `face` - Maps a copy of the texture onto every face. You should make points unique using a [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html \"Facet SOP\"), before using this function in the Texture SOP. The map is graphically projected to each face along its normal, so the texture is oriented properly for each face. However, the map is not scaled to fit each polygon, nor is it distorted by the shape of each polygon. If the geometry changes in size in object space, the texture does not \"stick\" to the geometry. It is best suited to texturing objects that represent chunks of rock and brick, as the textures will likely not match at the edges between polygons.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Modify Source `modify` - If the Source already has texture UV coordinates, they are maintained. You can offset and scale them, however, using Scale and Offset.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Uniform Spline `suniform` - This projection type operates only on NURBS and Bzier surfaces. It samples the domain space (i.e. the basis) of each surface uniformly in U and V and assigns those (u,v) values as texture coordinates to the surface points or vertices. To ensure continuity between the texture space of adjacent surfaces insert a [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html \"Basis SOP\") before the Texture SOP and toggle Concatenate on to merge the spline bases in U and/or V.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Average Spline `saverage` - Stores the average of degree successive knots into the texture attribute. These averages are known as **Greville points**. This method and Uniform Spline are recommended for pasted surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Arc Length Spline `sarclen` - This method is similar to the Uniform Spline method since it relies on the underlying spline basis when computing the texture coordinates. Both methods generate texture coordinates in the same range, bounded by the minimum and maximum knot values. The difference between the two spline methods lies in the spacing between successive texture coordinates. The uniform method samples the parameter space uniformly. The Arc-Length Spline method chooses the texture coordinates based on surface arc-lengths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Uniform Spline method relies heavily on the parametric fabric of the surface, the resulting texture will tend to squash and stretch given uneven surface parameterizations. The Arc-Length Spline method reduces this effect by relating the texture space directly to the world space of the surface, while ensuring that the size and origin of the generated texture space coincide with those of the underlying domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Edge Length `edgelength` - Applies to hulls + faces (NURBs/Bezier/Polygon).\n",
      "\n",
      "* Perspective From Camera `persp` - The texture coordinates are assigned so that the world space of the object can be textured to fit the projection of the camera exactly. If any points are behind the near clipping plane or beyond the far clipping plane, the texture coordinates (`0, 0, 0`) are assigned. Note: Unless a Custom Projection matrix is used in the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html \"Camera COMP\"), the aspect ratio of the projection is assumed to be 1:1. You may need to scale the UVs to match the aspect ratio of your render.\n",

Where there is a white pixel in the second input, it gets the most recent layer of the 3D texture. Black Offset and White Offset adjust the range of time that the black to white parts of the image are offset within. For example, if Black Offset is -10 and White Offset is 0, then a black pixel would be 10 frames behind in time, a white pixel the current frame, and a 50% grey pixel would be 5 frames behind in time (in between the Black and White Offsets).\n",

      "# Timer CHOP\n",
      "\n",
      "The Timer CHOP is an engine for running timed processes. It outputs channels such as timing fractions, counters, pulses and timer states, and it calls python functions (callbacks) when various timing events occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples using the Timer CHOP include triggering multiple timed cues, running playlists, timelines, state machines, and driving pre-animated animation components in 3D scenes. See Help -> Operator Snippets for numerous examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "You set a timer to a number of seconds (or unlimited), frames or samples, and trigger it to start via the Start parameter or the second input CHOP. The Timer CHOP outputs in seconds, frames, samples, fraction and on-off states as it’s counting, including a `done` channel that goes on when it is complete. When it reaches certain states like end-of-cycles or when it’s done, various python callbacks are called allowing you to customize its behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Timer CHOP gets triggered by events (via pulsing its parameters or driving its two inputs). It takes events in, counts time, changes state. Via its python callback functions, you can send events out to other nodes, set parameters, get/set values in DATs, CHOPs and storage, restart itself, or trigger other nodes. As such, it can operate as a state machine.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has play/pause, plus a speed control to slow down or speed up the timer.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can also cycle indefinitely and then can be signaled to end immediately or at the end of the current cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended**: the **OP Snippets for Timer CHOP**. See the channel descriptions in [Initialize Start](Initialize_Start.html \"Initialize Start\").\n",
      "\n",
      "**Multiple Timer segments** - One Timer CHOP can also have multiple timers within it. By attaching a Table DAT you can define one timer (segment) per row. In Serial Timers mode it allows for one time segment followed by another. In Parallel Timers mode, the timers all run in parallel, each with its own begin time and length, and its own set of output channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "[![Timer CHOP.2.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/8/82/Timer_CHOP.2.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Timer_CHOP.2.png)\n",
      "\n",
      "The Timer CHOP can be Locked to Timeline in a deterministic way, or run more freely in Sequential Mode. When run independently from the timeline, you can jump ahead, break out of cycles, pause, `goTo()` exact position or timecode in the timer, and dynamically adjust the speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attach an Info DAT to the Timer CHOP to see the timecodes, or use the `.timecode` members. Custom text strings can be placed in the Info DAT for each segment, and custom animated channels can be created.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make an entire Timer CHOP loop after the last segment, set the On Done menu to Re-Start.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip: What happens when you press Start** - The timers are at 0 when you initialize, for example timer\\_frames = 0. On the frame when you press Start, by default, the running channel goes from 0 to 1, all the timer counter channels step forward by 1 frame. If you want the timers to hold at 0 until the next frame, set the Delay parameter to 1 frame. This is useful when you are cutting from black to a visible first-frame of a movie. If the length of the timer is 100 frames, it will make the running channel on for 100 frames, otherwise it will be 99 (though subsequent cycles are always 100).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Chaining Timers** - The Timer CHOPs can be chained together, so that when one ends, the next can begin. They just need to all be Initialized together, where the `ready_pulse` channel of one Timer CHOP is exported to the Initialize parameter of the next Timer CHOP. Then they can be run in sequence, where the output of one Timer CHOP’s `done_pulse` channel is wired to the Start input (or exported to the Start parameter) of the next Timer CHOP. You start the chain of timers by starting the first Timer CHOP. By using some Timer CHOPs to loop awaiting input or response, or by adding logic to decide which CHOP to start next, state machines can be implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Callbacks\n",
      "\n",
      "The callbacks are called at different moments during the timer progression.\n",
      "\n",
      "`onInitialize()` gets called when you pulse the Initialize parameter. Here you can prepare any part of your setup prior to starting. At the end of Initialize the timer goes into a \"ready\" state.\n",
      "\n",
      "`onStart()` gets called on the frame that the Start parameter is pulsed. The timer then goes into a \"running\" state.\n",
      "\n",
      "`onTimerActive()` gets called every frame that the timer is running and there is no Delay or Play is off.\n",
      "\n",
      "`onCycleStart()` gets called if the timer is set to cycle via the Cycle parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before a cycle or segment ends, an `onCycleEndAlert()` callback based on the Cycle End Alert parameter can be called to allow you to prepare for the next cycle, segment or Timer CHOP.\n",
      "\n",
      "`onSegmentEnter()` and `onSegmentExit()` get called if the timer is being driven by a Segments DAT which acts like several timers in one. The argument `segment` in these callbacks is actually an object with useful members including any custom columns you have in your segment table: In `onSegmentEnter()`, put the code `print(help(segment))`\n",
      "\n",
      "`onDone()` gets called when the timer reaches its finished state.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can initialize at a specific time by using `.masterSeconds` in `onInitialize()`.\n",

      "\n",
      "Protocol `protocol` - ⊞ - Selects which network protocol to use to transfer data. Different protocol's have methods of connecting and using the address parameter. For more information refer to the [Network Protocols](Network_Protocols.html \"Network Protocols\") article.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Streaming (TCP/IP) `streaming` -\n",
      "\n",
      "Address `address` - The computer name or IP address of the server computer. You can use an IP address (e.g. `100.123.45.78`) or the computer's network name can be used directly. If you put \"`localhost`\", it means the other end of the pipe is on the same computer.\n",
      "Network Port `port` - The network port of the server.\n",
      "Active `active` - While on, the CHOP receives information from the pipe or server. While off, no updating occurs. Data sent by a server is lost, but a pipe will store the data until Active is turned on again. If in Network mode, turning this parameter on initiates a connection, and turning it off breaks the connection.\n",
      "Queue Target `queuetarget` - The target queue length the CHOP will attempt to maintain.\n",
      "Queue Target Unit `queuetargetunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.\n",
      "Queue Variance `queuevariance` - The range around the Queue Target that's acceptable. If the queue's length is within the target and variance range, the CHOP will not bother to adjust the queue length.\n",
      "Queue Variance Unit `queuevarianceunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.\n",
      "Maximum Queue `maxqueue` - The maximum size of the queue when full. Incoming samples will be dropped if the maximum queue is reached.\n",
      "Max Queue Unit `maxqueueunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.\n",
      "Queue Adjust Time `adjusttime` - Specifies how often to repeat/drop a samples in order to get closer to the queue target range. If the value = 1 and the units = seconds, then it will try to repeat/drop a sample once per second to maintain the queue target set in the Minimum Target and Maximum Target parameters above.\n",
      "Adjust Unit `adjusttimeunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.\n",
      "Recover Outside Range `recover` - If the queue size goes outside of the target size range for more than the 'adjust time', then if this option is on it will stop delivering new data or throw away a lot of data, until queue size is back in the middle of the min/max target. If this option is of the queue size will be slowly inched towards the target size instead (by dropping or repeating single frames every once in a while).\n",
      "Use Synced Ports `syncports` - ⊞ - This parameter lets you send the the data in a single global pipe if required. This can be important if various data streams must be sent in frame sync. For more information, refer to [Touch In/Out Synced Ports](https://docs.derivative.ca/Touch_In/Out_Synced_Ports \"Touch In/Out Synced Ports\").\n",
      "\n",
      "* Off `off` - Uses separate ports for each port number assigned.\n",

      "* On `on` - Uses a single global pipe for all Touch Out CHOPs using this Transfer Port Type. The global pipe uses port 10500 internally to send all the global port type data together at once. The Network Port parameter is still used to determine which Touch In CHOP gets the data on the receiving side.\n",

      "\n",
      "The USD COMP loads and imports most geometric schemas from a [USD](USD.html \"USD\") file in crate/binary or ASCII file formats with extensions as (`.usd`), (`.usda`), (`.usdc`), and (`.usdz`). Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD COMP. You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also [File Types](File_Types.html \"File Types\").\n",
      "\n",
      "To open a USD file in an USD COMP:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Specify a valid file path in the \"USD File\" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the \"Build Network\" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the \"Merge Geometry\" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the \"Build Network\" requires the network to be built again.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) The \"Reload\" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the `.toe` file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) The \"Update\" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.\n",

      "## Parameters - USD Page\n",
      "\n",
      "USD File `file` - The path to the USD file. The file can be a binary (.usd or .usdc) or ASCII format (.usda).\n",
      "Reload File `reload` - A pulse to reload the assets from the file without making any changes to the existing network.\n",
      "Use Material `usematerial` - A toggle to specify whether the material/shading be enabled for all the geometry primitives with material binding or not. By turning this toggle on, the MAT nodes and -according to the need- the ImportSelect TOPs for texture mapping assets are generated.\n",
      "Cameras `cameras` - A toggle to specify whether the Camera nodes (subject to be defined in the USD file) created for the USD COMP or not.\n",
      "Generate Actor COMPs `genactors` - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs.\n",
      "Merge Geometry `mergegeo` - A toggle to merge the mergeable geometries SOPs and their transformation COMPs up to a specified merge level. This feature can noticeably increase the performance of the USD COMP network.\n",
      "Merge Level `mergelevel` - Defines the desired merge level for merging the nodes. The start value is 1 which is the root of the network and it increases for the children of nodes the same as their positions within tree hierarchy. By default, this parameter is disabled and can be enabled once the toggle for Merge Geometry is set to ON.\n",
      "Max Wired Children `maxwiredchildren` - This value is used to define how many wired children a Geometry/Null COMP node can have on the same network level (note that this network level refers to all the nodes that can be seen on the same canvas network). If a node has more children than this value, all its children will be relocated inside of it. This is used to prune out the wired children nodes of a parent node to make a lighter and cleaner network. The default value is 5.\n",
      "Compute Normals `computenormals` - A toggle for generating normal vectors from subdivision schema specified from USD file using OpenSubdiv library. Turning this toggle to OFF makes will make the SOPs use the TouchDesigner generated normal instead (only CPU mode).\n",
      "Direct to GPU `gpudirect` - A toggle to load the geometry directly to the GPU. This makes the rendering much faster than CPU mode. However, currently the only supported geometries are mesh and point primitives. If a USD scene contains other prim types such as NURBs Patches, an error will be generated for each [Import Select SOP](Import_Select_SOP.html \"Import Select SOP\") that is not supported.\n",
      "Build Network `buildnetwork` - Every time (including the first time) you specify a new file, or change any parameter from the USD page, you need to re-build it, so it generates the network according to the current selected parameters.\n",
      "Keep Parameters `keepparams` - A toggle to keep the parameters of the current network over parameters of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n",
      "Keep Connections `keepconnections` - A toggle to keep the connection of the current network over the connections of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.\n",
      "Update `update` - Updates the network. This option is specifically useful when the USD file is edited after the USD network is imported in TouchDesigner.\n",
      "Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The Callbacks DAT will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.\n",
      "\n",
      "This page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shift Animation Start `shiftanimationstart` - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the USD file.\n",
      "Sample Rate Mode `sampleratemode` - ⊞ - A menu to choose between the file FPS or custom sample rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "* File FPS `filefps` - uses the FPS from what is defined in the USD file.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Custom `custom` - uses a desired value specified by Sample Rate parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extend Left `textendleft` - ⊞ - Determines how USD COMP handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extend Right `textendright` - ⊞ - Determines how USD COMP handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the animation position is calculated.\n",

      "The Warp CHOP time-warps the channels of the first input (the Pre-Warp Channels) using one warping channel in the second input (the Warp Curve). The Warp Curve acts as either a rate control or an index control, as explained below. The Warp CHOP usually works on non-time-sliced channels, like pre-key-framed channels of motion. See also the [Lookup CHOP](Lookup_CHOP.html \"Lookup CHOP\"), the [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html \"Speed CHOP\") and the [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html \"Audio Oscillator CHOP\").\n",

      "In the Rate Control Method, feeding the Warp CHOP a Warp Curve with a constant value of 1 makes the output identical to the Pre-Warp Channels, assuming the two inputs have the same start-end interval. That is, where the rate is 1, the Pre-Warp Channels are not warped.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the Warp Curve is above 1, it causes a speed-up in the animation. Where the Warp Curve is below 1, it causes a slow-down in the animation. Rates less than 0 cause the animation to go in reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Index Control Method, the Warp Curve acts as an index into the first input. If the Warp Curve is a straight ramp with a slope of 1 (in Units), it produces unwarped output channels. If Units is set to Seconds, a Warp Curve value of 0 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 0 seconds. A Warp Curve value of 2 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 2 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Warp CHOP will output the same number of channels and channel names as the Pre-Warp Channels input, and the sample rate will be the same as that of the Pre-Warp input. However, the CHOP will output the same start-end time interval as the Warp Curve input.\n",

      "The XML DAT can be used to parse arbitrary XML and SGML/HTML formatted data. Once formatted, selected sections of the text can be output for further processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach to parsing with the XML DAT is to read the XML with a Text DAT or a Web DAT, and pass that to a default XML DAT. Then you start to refine your selection by changing the match-all pattern (the \"\\*\"), to strings that reduce the elements that are in the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "### XML and HTML Background\n",
      "\n",
      "XML and HTML data consists of a tree like structure consisting of elements. Each element can be either tagged or contain arbitrary text. Elements may be nested. Tagged elements begin with an opening section and usually are terminated with a closing section.\n",

      "### XML DAT Operation\n",
      "\n",
      "The XML DAT begins by parsing its input, creating an internal tree of elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The **Element Scope** parameters are then used to filter out unwanted elements. The remaining elements are then used to create the output. The format of the output is determined by the **Format** parameters. The **Output** parameters can then be used to futher limit the information displayed for each scoped element.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each parsed element contains a number of details:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Label** - Each element is given an arbitrary label named n0, n1, n2 etc. All elements are children of the reserved element labelled 'root'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Type** - Elements are mainly of type 'tag' or 'text', though tag types can be further classified into 'doctype', 'declaration', 'comment' or 'entity'.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Text** - The text of an element refers to the tag attribute of an element, or the arbitrary text contents. In the above example, the first element would be of type 'tag' and contain text of 'greeting'. The second element would be of type 'text' and contain text of 'Hello there.'\n",
      "\n",
      "**Level** - This describes how deeply nested an element is. For example the single root element always has a level of 0.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**Children** - Each element can have an arbitrary number of children elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Attributes** - Each tagged element can have an arbitrary number of attributes. Each attribute consists of a name and a value. In the above example, the greeting tag would contain 3 attributes (with names a, b and c and values 1, 2, and 3 respectively).\n",
