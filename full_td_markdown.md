## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]

The Ableton Link CHOP retrieves timing information from an Ableton Link supported network.
For more information see: <http://www.ableton.com/en/link/>

The full support of the Ableton Live system is [TDAbleton](TDAbleton.html "TDAbleton"), a group of components that give you access to Ableton Songs, Tracks, Chains, Parameters and MIDI.

Ableton's Link FAQ is very helpful for issues on the Ableton end: <https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209776125-Link-FAQs>.

One common problem is that Ableton Link doesn't work with all sound drivers, including DirectX. The free application [ASIO4All](http://www.asio4all.com/) is an easy replacement that acts as a virtual ASIO device.

## Parameters - Ableton Page

Active `active` - Turns the CHOP's output on or off.
Enable `enable` - Initializes the connection to the Ableton Link session.
Start Stop Sync Enable `startstopsync` - Enables start stop synchronization for the entire Ableton Link session. Start stop synchronization allows for sharing of start or stop signals between subgroups of peers in a Link session.
Signature `signature` - ⊞ - Specifies the time signature. The first number is the number of beats per measure and the second number indicates the type of note that constitutes one beat. See [Time Signature - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature) for additional information.

* `signature1` -

* `signature2` -

Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callbacks for each event received.

## Parameters - Output Page

Status Channels `status` - Enables the following status channels

* numpeers - number of Ableton Link enabled devices or app found on the network.
* linked - if the Ableton Link CHOP is connected to the Link network.
* waiting - if the Ableton Link CHOP is in a waiting state and not synced.
* synced - if the Ableton Link CHOP has synced with the Link network.

Ramp `ramp` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.
Pulse `pulse` - Outputs a pulse each bar.
Sine `sine` - Outputs a sine wave each bar.
Count `count` - Increases the count each bar.
Count+Ramp `countramp` - A ramp that counts up until the bar is reset.
Bar `bar` - Output the current bar.
Beat `beat` - Output the current beat.
Sixteenths `sixteenths` - Output the current sixteenths.
Ramp Bar `rampbar` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.
Ramp Beat `rampbeat` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each beat.
Tempo `tempo` - Outputs the current tempo (also known as BPM).
Beats `beats` - Outputs the total number of beats.
Phase `phase` - Outputs the current phase in the bar.

## Parameters - Common Page

Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.

* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.

* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.

* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.

* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.

* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.

* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

A [Link](Link.html "Link"). The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").

A Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP [Exports](Export.html "Export"), node [Paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path") in parameters, and [expressions](Expression.html "Expression") in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a [Wire](Wire.html "Wire") that connects nodes in the same [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.

A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.

samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.

Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").

Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.

TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.

absTime Class - Derivative

# absTime Class

This class contains information on the "[absolute time](Absolute_Time.html "Absolute Time")", the time TouchDesigner has been running since the process started. It can be accessed with the abstime object, found in the automatically imported [td module](Td_Module.html "Td Module"). It is paused only with the power on/off button at the top of the UI, or with the power() method in the [td module](Td_Module.html "Td Module"). Absolute time is the same for all nodes and is not affected by the pausing any component's timeline. See [absolute time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_time_and_space).

## Members

`frame` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Absolute total number of frames played since the application started. Paused only with the power On/Off or with power()
> 
> ```
> Example: absTime.frame
> Example: tdu.rand(absTime.frame + .1) # a unique random number that is consistent across all nodes, changing every frame
> 
> ```

`seconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Absolute total seconds played since the application started. Paused only with the power On/Off or with power().

`step` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Number of absolute frames elapsed between start of previous and current frame. When this value is greater than 1, the system is dropping frames.

`stepSeconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Absolute time elapsed between start of previous and current frame.

## Methods

No operator specific methods.

Actor COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Actor COMP

An Actor COMP is analogous to a body (or bodies) in a physics system. An Actor COMP must be used in conjunction with a physics solver: either a [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP") or [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html "Nvidia Flex Solver COMP"), which in turn is analogous to the world/simulation that the actors/bodies operate in. An Actor COMP can either be static, meaning it is not affected by any forces in the simulation and cannot move (ie. has infinite mass), or it can be dynamic, meaning it is moved by forces and collides with other bodies (either static or dynamic) in the world.

## Usage

### Actors in Bullet

Static bodies can be concave or convex, but dynamic bodies must be convex. However, dynamic collision shapes can be compound, meaning it is a collision shape made of other collision shapes. So, a concave collision shape can be created in the dynamic case by building it out of a group of convex shapes. This can be done using multiple SOPs. Each SOP must be convex, but combination of the SOPs does not need to be. If Automatic mode is selected, then a compound collision shape will be created from these SOPs.

All bodies in an Actor COMP have a corresponding collision shape. The collision shape is what determines how objects will collide with one another, and it is important to note that what is seen in the viewer/render will not necessarily directly match the collision shape.

Collision shapes are created using SOPs, either through the "Collision SOPs" parameter or by putting them inside the Actor COMP itself. If the "Collision SOPs" parameter is filled in, then the Actor COMP will create a single body from all the SOPs at that given paths (if the path is a COMP then it will recursively grab all the SOPs in the COMP). If there is nothing filled in for the "Collision SOPs" parameter, then the Actor COMP will instead recursively search inside itself for any SOPs that have both their display and render flags on. The Actor COMP will create a single body and corresponding collision shape from these SOPs.

There are several options when it comes to creating a collision shape out of the SOPs. These options can be chosen from the "Collision Shape" parameter. For instance, the option "Oriented Bounding Box" will create a minimum volume bounding box around the selected SOPs.

To create multiple bodies, use the instancing on the "Instance" page of the Actor COMP. This will create any number of identical bodies, each with their own identical collision shape. Currently there is no way to create multiple non-identical bodies in a single Actor COMP.

Bodies are initialized using the "Initialize Actor" parameter, so if any changes are made to the SOPs that create the bodies, then the Actor COMP must be reinitialized. Bodies will automatically be re-initialized if the Kinematic State, Shape, or Center of Mass is changed.

Transforms can be applied to an Actor COMP using the Xform and Pre-Xform pages, much like on a Geometry COMP or Camera COMP. The transforms on the Xform and Pre-Xform pages create the initial transform of the actor in the simulation, but they can also be used to modify the transform of an actor during a simulation. Changing scale on either page will require a reinitialization of the actor since it changes the collision shape itself. Modifying any of the transforms while instancing will automatically reinitialize the actor.

Actor COMPs cannot be nested; however, Actor COMPs can be nested inside Geometry COMPs and vice versa. Geometry COMPs with a nested Actor COMPs cannot have any scale transform; however, Geometry COMPs nested inside an Actor COMP can have scale. An Actor COMP nested inside Geometry COMPs will use their transform only when it is initialized. Therefore, any changes to the transform of these Geometry COMPs will require a reinitialization of the Actor COMP.

### Actors in Flex

[Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex "Flex") actors can either be fluid particles, a fluid particle emitter, or a static shape.

Static shapes in Flex are built in the same way that concave (ie. static) shapes are built in Bullet. Static shapes require a triangle mesh SOP to build up their collision shape. However, box/sphere collision shape options can also be used to create a bounding box/sphere of the collision shape SOP.

Fluid particles behave much the same way as instancing on a Bullet actor. The number of fluid particles is equal to the number of instances created from an instance OP. The instance parameters are used to give the particle an initial transform, but once the simulation is running the transform is updated from the simulation results.

One key difference of a fluid particle Actor COMP is that no SOP is needed to create a fluid particle since their size/behaviour is defined through the simulation parameters on the [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html "Nvidia Flex Solver COMP"). A SOP in the Actor COMP can be used to the render/display the positions of the particles. Alternatively, the particle positions can be fetched using the [Nvidia Flex TOP](Nvidia_Flex_TOP.html "Nvidia Flex TOP").

Fluid emitters add particles to the scene at the emission point (ie. the transform of the Actor COMP). Particles are added up until the emission maximum is reached, at which point emission particles will be recycled from already existing particles.

### Using an Actor COMP

When creating an Actor COMP there are some important questions to consider:

* **Will this Actor be in a Bullet or Flex simulation?** There are many commonalities between Bullet actors and Flex actors, however they do differ in their functionality, meaning that not all parameters overlap. For Bullet specific parameters see the Bullet page of the Actor COMP and for Flex specific parameters see the Flex page of the Actor COMP.
* **Will the bodies move?** A moving body's Kinematic State must be dynamic. A static body can "move" by overriding its position, but this is not recommended since clipping can easily occur and and collisions will be incorrect (because the bodies won't have momentum).
* **What SOPs will be used to create the collision shape?** Every Actor COMP has a corresponding collision shape that is created from SOPs. The SOPs can be set through the Collision SOPs parameter, or if that parameter is not set, through the display/render flags of SOPs inside the Actor COMP.
* **What collision shape will be used?** The SOPs gathered in the previous stage are used to create the collision shape. Each collision shape has their own pros and cons, which are outlined on the [Bullet Dynamics](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") page. The collision shape is what determines how the body will interact with other bodies (ie. collide). The collision shape does not necessarily correspond with what is displayed/rendered. The collision shape can be shown using the Display Collision Shape toggle.
* **Will the collision shape be concave?** If the collision shape is concave and static, simply select Concave from the drop-down menu. If the collision shape is to be concave and dynamic then there is an extra step: convex decomposition. The collision shape must be a Compound collision shape (ie. a group of convex collision shapes) where each part of the compound shape is convex, but combined together create a concave shape. Each part of the compound shape is represented using a single SOP. Consider the letter "T" as an example. "T" is concave so it will need to be split into two separate convex parts: the top line and the bottom line. 2 SOPs would be created (one for each line) for the collision shape that when combined together form the full concave "T". If the "T" were static however, it could remain as 1 SOP.

### Why are my bodies not colliding?

To understand why two bodies might not collide it is important to understand that Bullet simulates discretely. Speed, position, constraints, collisions are all calculated on a frame by frame basis, as opposed to continuously. In the case of Bullet, collisions are calculated at the beginning and the end of a frame. What this means is that if a body is moving a large distance every frame it can clip through other bodies, because it's not colliding with it at the beginning or the end of the frame when collision is calculated. In the same vein, if an object is very thin then other bodies will be able to clip through it easier than something with more depth because bodies won't have to move as far in a frame to completely jump over it.

Continuous collision detection (see parameter) helps to fix this by performing collision detection along the movement vector (between start/end of frame) so that collisions happening between the start/end of frame will be caught. This helps significantly with high linear velocity bodies, but not so much high angular velocity bodies.

A couple other things to consider changing to fix body "leaking":

1. Manually limit the velocity of bodies, or lower the strength of the forces being applied.
2. Add depth to very thin collision surfaces. If you're using a Grid SOP as a collision surface, consider using a Box SOP instead. Or, if you're using a Box SOP as the collision shape to contain other bodies inside, consider making the collision shape out of 6 individual Box SOPs (one for each side of the box) combined together.

## Parameters - General Page

Initialize Actor `initialize` - Recreates the collision shapes for all the bodies in the Actor COMP. Also resets all velocities and position to their default state. Initialize Actor should be pulsed when any changes are made to the SOPs used for creating the collision shape, or for any changes to the instancing OP.
Update Collision Shape `updatecs` - If enabled the Actor COMP will automatically update collision shapes. This will occur when the "Collision SOPs" or "Collision Shape" parameters are changes or the underlying SOPs used to create the collision shape are changed (ie. when their cook count increases).
Update Collision Shape `updatecspulse` - When clicked this will instantly update the collosion shape.
Active `active` - Toggle the actor on/off. If the actor is active, then it will be updated as the simulation progress. However, if it is inactive, then it will be removed from the simulation and no longer collide with any of the other actors/bodies. As a result, it's transform will also no longer be updated.
Kinematic State `kinstate` - ⊞ - The kinematic state defines the Actor COMPs ability to move from external forces. If an object is dynamic, then it is moveable in the simulation, but if it static then it is not.

* Static (Infinite Mass) `static` - The bodies in this COMP cannot be moved in the simulation.

* Dynamic (Finite Mass) `dynamic` - The bodies in this COMP can move.

Collision SOPs `sops` - Specifies SOPs or COMPs to use for the collision shape. If a SOP is referenced, then just that SOP will be used for the collision shape. But if a COMP is selected then all SOPs inside of that (recursive) will be used for the collision shape. If this parameter is left blank, then the SOPs selected will be all SOPs inside the Actor COMP with display and render flags on.
Collision Shape `shape` - ⊞ - The type of collision shape to make from the selected SOPs. Collision shapes can be viewed using a guide in the Actor COMP's viewer

* Concave (Static only) `concave` - Creates a concave collision shape out of all the SOPs. Should only be used for static Actor COMPs. The SOPs used for creating the concave collisions shape should only have polygons with either 3 or 4 vertices. If this mode is selected for a dynamic Actor COMP then a compound shape will be created instead.

* Convex Hull `convex` - Creates a convex hull out of all the SOPs. A convex hull is a set of points that encloses all other points (in this case, the points from the SOPs), and the shape created from these points is convex. The points of the convex hull will be points from the original set of points (ie. the ones from the SOPs)

* Oriented Bounding Box `obb` - Creates a bounding box around the SOPs that is oriented to minimize volume.

* Axis-Aligned Bounding Box `aabb` - Creates a bounding box around the SOPs that has its axis aligned with XYZ (so it's not rotated).

* Bounding Ellipsoid `bellipsoid` - Creates a minimum volume bounding ellipsoid around the SOP.

* Bounding Sphere `bsphere` - creates a minimum volume bounding sphere around the SOPs. The difference between this and bounding ellipsoid is that all radii are the same (XYZ).

* Compound `compound` - A compound collision shape is a collision shape composed of other collision shapes. If the Actor COMP is static then this has the same result as a concave shape. If the Actor COMP is dynamic then each SOP will be created into its own convex hull, then these will all be subsequently merged together into a single compound collision shape. This mode allows you to create concave collision shapes for dynamic bodies using multiple convex SOPs.

Ellipsoid Tolerance `elltol` - The tolerance of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid. In other words, how close to the optimal solution it is.
Infinite Mass `infinitemass` - Give the actor infinite mass. If the object is dynamic this will make it unmovable and static. Toggling infinite mass on or off will not require recreation of the collision shape, unlike changing the Kinematic State parameter.
Mass `mass` - The mass in kilograms of the actor.
Cue Velocity `cuevel` - Holds the linear and angular velocity and values given by linvel and angvel. The object will still collide with any other bodies in the simulation.
Cue Pulse `cuevelpulse` - Pulse the linear and angular velocity to values given by linvel and angvel. This will set the velocity to the given value at the beginning of the next frame.
Linear Velocity `linvel` - ⊞ - The initial linear velocity of the actor in m/s. This parameter can also be used to modify an actor's linear velocity during a simulation. Additionally, it is used in conjunction with the "Cue Velocity" and "Cue Velocity Pulse" parameters.

* Linear Velocity `linvelx` -

* Linear Velocity `linvely` -

* Linear Velocity `linvelz` -

Angular Velocity `angvel` - ⊞ - The initial angular velocity of the actor in degrees per second in m/s. This parameter can also be used to modify the actor's angular velocity during a simulation. Additionally, it is used in conjunction with the "Cue Velocity" and "Cue Velocity Pulse" parameters.

* Angular Velocity `angvelx` -

* Angular Velocity `angvely` -

* Angular Velocity `angvelz` -

## Parameters - Bullet Page

Forces `forces` - A list of local forces, meaning forces (ie. Force COMPs) that will only be applied to this actor.
Use Global Gravity `globalgrav` - Toggle for whether to use the Bullet Solver COMP's gravity (global), or its own local gravity.
Gravitational Acceleration `gravity` - ⊞ - Actor's local gravity in m/s^2. Will only be applied if the actor is not using the Bullet Solver COMP's global gravity ie. the "Use Global Gravity" parameter above is turned off.

* Gravitational Acceleration `gravityx` -

* Gravitational Acceleration `gravityy` -

* Gravitational Acceleration `gravityz` -

Friction `friction` - The kinetic friction of the actor. It is the resistance between two bodies rubbing/sliding. The overall friction is the product of the two bodies touching. For example, if one body has 0 friction and the other has 1, then the overall friction between the two bodies is 0.
Rolling Friction `rollfric` - The rolling friction of the actor. It is the resistance/drag of one body (such as a sphere or cone) rolling on another.
Restitution `rest` - The coefficient of restitution of the actor. The coefficient of restitution is the ratio of the final to initial relative between two bodies/actors when they collide. In other words, restitution is the fraction of kinetic energy preserved after a collision. If two objects collide with 100% (ie. 1) restitution, then, both bodies will bounce off each other at the same speed at which they collided.
Continuous Collision Detection `ccd` - Toggles continuous collision detection on/off for this actor. Typically, collision detection is done discretely, meaning that collision is verified at the beginning/end of a frame. However, if a body is going too fast it will move too far in a single frame and therefore clip through any surfaces (ie. No collision detected). Continuous collision detection improves upon this by performing collision detection at intervals between the body's initial and final positions within a frame. Continuous collision detection can affect performance, so even if the parameter is toggled on it will not be used all the time. It will only be used for bodies moving above a velocity threshold.
Display Guide `dispguide` - Toggles on the display for the collision shape in the COMP viewer.
Center of Mass `com` - ⊞ - Specifies the center of mass of the collision shape. The center of mass is the point around which the body will rotate. Center of mass can be viewed using a guide in the Actor COMP's viewer. It is shown as a red axis.

* Center of Mass `comx` -

* Center of Mass `comy` -

* Center of Mass `comz` -

Bullet Feedback CHOP `bulletfb` - A reference to a CHOP from which to feedback. The Actor COMP will read transformation and velocity data (in the correct format, see Bullet Solver CHOP for more information) from the CHOP, and overwrite the current values at the beginning of the next frame. A feedback loop can be created with this parameter and the Bullet Solver CHOP. See Bullet Solver CHOP. NOTE: scale cannot be feedbacked. force[xyz] and torque[xyz] can be used to apply forces to specific bodies.

## Parameters - Flex Page

Enable Emission `emit` - When enabled, the Actor COMP will actively emit particles.
Emission Size `emitsize` - ⊞ - The size of the 2D emission grid. The size represents the number of particles on each side of the emission grid. For example, a 2x5 emission size will emit a grid 2 particles wide and 5 particles high.

* Emission Size `emitsizex` -

* Emission Size `emitsizey` -

Emission Speed `emitspeed` - The speed the particles come out of the emitter.
Max Emission Particles `emitmax` - Sets the maximum number of particles in the Actor COMP. Once this number is reached, emission will be done by recycling existing particles in the Actor COMP.
Position Feedback TOP `flexposfb` - A reference to a TOP to feedback position. The TOP should be encoded with the position data that will be used to override position in the simulation. The texture data will be read to correspond with the Flex TOP's position texture.
Velocity Feedback TOP `flexvelfb` - A reference to a TOP to feedback velocity. The TOP should be encoded with the velocity data that will be used to override velocity in the simulation. The texture data will be read to correspond with the Flex TOP's velocity texture.

## Parameters - Xform Page

The Xform parameter page controls the object component's transform in world space.

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - This allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your Component will take place. Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as `T * R * S * Position`.

* Scale Rotate Translate `srt` -

* Scale Translate Rotate `str` -

* Rotate Scale Translate `rst` -

* Rotate Translate Scale `rts` -

* Translate Scale Rotate `tsr` -

* Translate Rotate Scale `trs` -

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - This allows you to set the transform order for the Component's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the Component's rotations take place will alter the Component's final position. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows `R = Rz * Ry * Rx`

* Rx Ry Rz `xyz` - `R = Rz * Ry * Rx`

* Rx Rz Ry `xzy` - `R = Ry * Rz * Rx`

* Ry Rx Rz `yxz` - `R = Rz * Rx * Ry`

* Ry Rz Rx `yzx` - `R = Rx * Rz * Ry`

* Rz Rx Ry `zxy` - `R = Ry * Rx * Rz`

* Rz Ry Rx `zyx` - `R = Rx * Ry * Rz`

Translate `t` - ⊞ - This allows you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the Component in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.

* X `tx` -

* Y `ty` -

* Z `tz` -

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - Theis specifies the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the Component in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.

* X `rx` -

* Y `ry` -

* Z `rz` -

* X `sx` -

* Y `sy` -

* Z `sz` -

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which a Component scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a Component produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the Component.

For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an Component is located at `-1, -1, 0` and you wanted to scale the Component by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%), the Component would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.

[![Objects17.gif](images/6/60/Objects17.gif)](File_Objects17.html)

In the example above, rotations performed on an Component with different pivot points produce very different results.

* X `px` -

* Y `py` -

* Z `pz` -

Uniform Scale `scale` - This field allows you to change the size of an Component uniformly along the three axes.
> **Note:** Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.

Parent Transform Source `parentxformsrc` - ⊞ - ***NOTE:** This parameter replaces the previous '**Constrain To'** parameter.* Use 'Parent Transform Source' and to specify what initial position is used for this object. Can be one of "Parent (Hierarchy)", "Specify Parent Object", or "World Origin".

* From Parent Object (Hierarchy) `hierarchy` -

* Specify Parent Object `specify` -

* World Origin `worldorigin` -

Parent Object `parentobject` - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.
Look At `lookat` - Allows you to orient this Component by naming another 3D Component you would like it to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this Component to look at, it will continue to face that Component, even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another Component's movements. The Look At parameter points the Component in question at the other Component's origin.
> **Tip:** To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null Component and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.

Forward Direction `forwarddir` - ⊞ - Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.

* +X `posx` -

* -X `negx` -

* +Y `posy` -

* -Y `negy` -

* +Z `posz` -

* -Z `negz` -

Look At Up Vector `lookup` - ⊞ - When specifying a Look At, it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat Component, for example, passes through the Y axis of the target Component.

* Don't Use Up Vector - Use this option if the look at Component does not pass through the Y axis of the target Component.
* Use Up Vector - This precisely defines the rotates on the Component doing the looking. The Up Vector specified should not be parallel to the look at direction. See Up Vector below.
* Use Quaternions - Quaternions are a mathematical representation of a 3D rotation. This method finds the most efficient means of moving from one point to another on a sphere.

* Don't use up vector `off` -

* Use up vector `on` -

* Use quaternions `quat` -

* Use Roll `roll` -

Path SOP `pathsop` - Names the SOP that functions as the path you want this Component to move along. For instance, you can name a SOP that provides a path for the camera to follow.
Roll `roll` - Using the angle control you can specify a Component's rotation as it animates along the path.
Position `pos` - This parameter lets you specify the Position of the Component along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from `0` to `1`, where `0` equals the starting point and `1` equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as `10` for multiple "passes" along the path.
Orient along Path `pathorient` - If this option is selected, the Component will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the Component will be pointing down the path.
Orient Up Vector `up` - ⊞ - When orienting a Component, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.

* X `upx` -

* Y `upy` -

* Z `upz` -

Auto-Bank Factor `bank` - The Auto-Bank Factor rolls the Component based on the curvature of the path at its current position. To turn off auto-banking, set the bank scale to `0`.

## Parameters - Pre-Xform Page

The Pre-Xform parameter page applies a transform to the object component the same way connecting another [Object](Object.html "Object") as a parent of this node does. The transform is applied to the left of the [Xform](Object_COMP_Xform_Page.html "Object COMP Xform Page") page's parameters. In terms of matrix math, if we use the 'multiply on the right' (column vector) convention, the equation would be `preXForm * xform * Position`.

For information on ways to specify a matrix directly, refer to the [Matrix Parameters](Matrix_Parameters.html "Matrix Parameters") page. This transform will be applied after the regular Pre-Transform transformation. That is, it'll be applied in the oder XformMatrix \* PreXForm \* Position.

## Parameters - Instance Page

The Instance parameter page provides the ability to create hardware instances of geometry. Each instance has an instance ID which can be passed into a [MAT](MAT.html "MAT") shader via a uniform value. The instance ID can be retrieved by the [Render Pick CHOP](Render_Pick_CHOP.html "Render Pick CHOP"). Any code in a vertex shader can customize the instance based on the instance ID.

Instance's attributes can be individually driven by the data from any type of OP. When the instance data is supplied by a TOP, the TOP's RGBA channels are assigned to instance attributes, when data is supplied by a CHOP, the CHOP's channels are assigned to instance attributes, when from a SOP then the SOP's attributes are assigned to instance attributes, and when a DAT is used then a column is assigned to the instances attributes. The mapping of operator data to instance attributes is setup on the parameters below and on the Instance 2 and Instance 3 parameter pages.

Instancing `instancing` - Turns on instancing for the Geometry Component.
Instance Count Mode `instancecountmode` - ⊞ - Two modes to determine how many instances will be created.

* Manual `manual` - Use the Num Instances parameter below to set the number of instances.

* Instance OP(s) Length `oplength` - The number of CHOP samples/DAT rows in the Instance CHOP/DAT determines the number of instances.

Num Instances `numinstances` - When using the Manual mode for Instance Count, this parameter set the number of instances.
Default Instance OP `instanceop` - Specify a path to a CHOP or DAT used to transform the instances. Number of samples/rows in this CHOP or DAT determines the number of instances when using the CHOP Length/DAT Num Rows mode for Instance Count.
First Row is `instancefirstrow` - ⊞ - What to do with the first row of a table DAT when using DAT rows for Instance Count.

* Ignored `ignored` - The first row is ignored and it's values won't be used as part of an instance. Indices must be used to select the columns to use for instance attributes.

* Names `names` - The first row contains column names which can be used to select which columns to use from the table.

* Values `values` - The first row is considered to contain values for the first instance. Indices must be used to select the columns to use for instance attributes.

Rotate Order `instrord` - ⊞ - The rotational matrix presented when you click on this option allows you to set the transform order for the Component's rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the Component's rotations take place will alter the Component's final position.

Active `instanceactive` - Select the data channel that will be used to control which instances are rendered. Only instances with a non-zero value in this channel will be rendered; instances with a zero active channel value will be skipped. If no data is assigned to this channel then all instances are rendered. Use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.

### Instance Texturing

This feature allows for arbitrary textures to be applied to instances. The textures do not need to be the same resolution, and they don't need to be combined into an grouped format such as a 3D Texture or a 2D Texture array. Multiple TOPs can be specified using the "Instance Textures" parameter, and the texture that is applied per-instance is specified using the channel chosen in the "Texture Index" parameter. This is different from a 3D Texture or 2D Texture Array, which would use the W texture coordinate to select a texture from within a single texture. By default this texture will be used as the "Base Color Map" texture for a [PBR MAT](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT"), and the Color Map for all other materials such as the [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT"). For materials that support more than one map, the map that this this feature replaces can be chosen in the material's parameters. Currently on Windows at most 16384 textures can be used at once, and on macOS at most 128 textures can be used at once. These numbers are reduced by other textures that are used by the render such as other maps, cone light lookup map etc.

Tex Index OP `instancetexindexop` - Select a specific operator to get data from for the Texture Index instance attribute below. If not specified, the the operator specified in the 'Default Instance OP' on the Instance parameter page can be used.
Texture Index `instancetexindex` - Select what data to select which texture to use for the instances, use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.

## Parameters - Instance 3 Page

Custom attributes allow arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances, usable in a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT"). They can be accessed using `TDInstanceCustomAttrib0()`, `TDInstanceCustomAttrib1()` etc. For more information refer to [Write a GLSL Material](Write_a_GLSL_Material.html "Write a GLSL Material"). These attributes will be ignored in other materials such as the [PBR MAT](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT").

Below you can add more parameters as you require more custom attributes. Different GPUs will have a different number of maximum custom attributes supported.

Custom Instance `instance` - Sequence of arbitrary attributes to be assigned to instances
OP `instance0customop` - Select a specific operator to get data from for the instance attributes below. If not specified, the the operator specified in the 'Default Instance OP' on the Instance parameter page can be used.
X `instance0customx` - Select what data to use for this instance attribute, use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.
Y `instance0customy` - Select what data to use for this instance attribute, use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.
Z `instance0customz` - Select what data to use for this instance attribute, use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.
W `instance0customw` - Select what data to use for this instance attribute, use the drop-down menu on the right to easily select from the available options.

## Parameters - Render Page

The Display parameter page controls the component's [material](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Material&action=edit&redlink=1 "Material (page does not exist)") and [rendering](Rendering.html "Rendering") settings.

Material `material` - Selects a [MAT](MAT.html "MAT") to apply to the geometry inside.
Render `render` - Whether the Component's geometry is visible in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the Component's [Render Flag](Render_Flag.html "Render Flag").
Draw Priority `drawpriority` - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent Component, or if the Component is the top level one listed in the Render TOP's 'Geometry' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with [Transparency](Transparency.html "Transparency").
Pick Priority `pickpriority` - When using a [Render Pick CHOP](Render_Pick_CHOP.html "Render Pick CHOP") or a [Render Pick DAT](Render_Pick_DAT.html "Render Pick DAT"), there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.
Wireframe Color `wcolor` - ⊞ - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the Component's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.

* Red `wcolorr` -

* Green `wcolorg` -

* Blue `wcolorb` -

Light Mask `lightmask` - By default all lights used in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") as well as this parameter to be used.

## Parameters - Extensions Page

The Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions. Please see [extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions") for more information.

Extension `ext` - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component
Object `ext0object` - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.
Name `ext0name` - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.
Promote `ext0promote` - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the `.ext` member. Example: `n.Somefunction` vs `n.ext.Somefunction`

Re-Init Extensions `reinitextensions` - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.

The Common parameter page sets the component's [node viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer") and [clone](Clone.html "Clone") relationships.

Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See [Parent Shortcut](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut").
Global OP Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut").
Internal OP `iop` - Sequence header for internal operators.
Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").
OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").

Node View `nodeview` - ⊞ - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer"). Some options will not be available depending on the Component type ([Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component"), [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component"), Misc.)

* Default Viewer `default` - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a Control Panel Viewer for Panel COMPs.

* Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.

Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](Clone.html "Clone").
Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
Enable External .tox `enableexternaltox` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
Enable External .tox Pulse `enableexternaltoxpulse` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present).
External .tox Path `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
Relative File Path Behavior `relpath` - ⊞ - Set whether the child file paths within this COMP are relative to the .toe itself or the .tox, or inherit from parent.

* Use Parent's Behavior `inherit` - Inherit setting from parent.

* Relative to Project File (.toe) `project` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .toe file.

* Relative to External COMP File (.tox) `externaltox` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .tox file. When no external COMP file is specified, or when Enable External .tox is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.

Extra Information for the Actor COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

A [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.

(1) A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") can instance and render its SOP geometry many times: once for each sample in a CHOP, row of a DAT table, pixel in a TOP, or point of a SOP, (2) An instance is an OP that doesn't actually have its own data, but rather just refers to an OP (or has an input) whose data it uses. This includes Null OPs, Switch OPs and in some cases Select OPs.

Any of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They "cook" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See [Node](Node.html "Node").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.

Hierarchy relates components with other components. There are two groups of Hierarchy in TouchDesigner. 3D Object Components, and 2D Panel Components. Hierarchies let one component to be positioned relative to another. Each group can be connected via lines between the bottoms/tops of nodes in a network, or by placing one component inside the other.

The sub-[Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") of [Component](Component.html "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

Operators that need 1 or more inputs are called Filters in TouchDesigner, like a Math CHOP. See [Generator](Generator.html "Generator").

MATs or Materials are an [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that applies a [Shader](Shader.html "Shader") to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.

The 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP").

Any component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.

A Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax `parent.Name`, for example `parent.Effect.width` to obtain panel width.

A name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.

Operator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include [Parent Shortcuts](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut") for accessing a component from within that component, and [Global OP Shortcuts](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut") that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.

The viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer")), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a [Pane](Pane.html "Pane") that graphically shows the results of an operator.

A custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using [Panel Components](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component").

Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](Component.html "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the [Replicator COMP](Replicator_COMP.html "Replicator COMP").

TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](Component.html "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.

TOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.

There are 2 kinds of parenting. The "parent component" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root `/` is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also [3D Parenting](3D_Parenting.html "3D Parenting") and panel [Parenting](Parent.html "Parent").

### Storage[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Storage")]

[Storage](Storage.html "Storage") can be used to keep data within components. Storage is implemented as one python dictionary per node.

When an element of storage is changed by using `n.store()` as explained below, expressions and operators that depend on it will automatically re-cook. It is retrieved with the `n.fetch()` function.

Storage is saved in `.toe` and `.tox` files and restored on startup.

Storage can hold any python object type (not just strings as in Tscript variables). Storage elements can also have optional startup values, specified separately. Use these startup values for example, to avoid saving and loading some session specific object, and instead save or load a well defined object like `None`.

See the [Examine DAT](Examine_DAT.html "Examine DAT") for procedurally viewing the contents of storage.

`fetch(key, default, search=True, storeDefault=False)`→ `value`:

> Return an object from the OP storage dictionary. If the item is not found, and a default it supplied, it will be returned instead.
> 
> * key - The name of the entry to retrieve.
> * default - (Optional) If provided and no item is found then the passed value/object is returned instead.
> * storeDefault - (Keyword, Optional) If True, and the key is not found, the default is stored as well.
> * search - (Keyword, Optional) If True, the parent of each OP is searched recursively until a match is found
> 
> ```
> v = n.fetch('sales5', 0.0)
> 
> ```

`fetchOwner(key)`→ `OP`:

> Return the operator which contains the stored key, or None if not found.
> 
> * key - The key to the stored entry you are looking for.
> 
> ```
> who = n.fetchOwner('sales5') #find the OP that has a storage entry called 'sales5'
> 
> ```

`store(key, value)`→ `value`:

> Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage dictionary, or replace it if it already exists. If this value is not intended to be saved and loaded in the toe file, it can be be given an alternate value for saving and loading, by using the method storeStartupValue described below.
> 
> * key - A string name for the storage entry. Use this name to retrieve the value using fetch().
> * value - The value/object to store.
> 
> ```
> n.store('sales5', 34.5) # stores a floating point value 34.5.
> n.store('moviebank', op('/project1/movies')) # stores an OP for easy access later on.
> 
> ```

`unstore(keys1, keys2..)`→ `None`:

> For key, remove it from the OP's storage dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well.
> 
> * keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage dictionary.
> 
> ```
> n.unstore('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage that start with 'sales'
> 
> ```

`storeStartupValue(key, value)`→ `None`:

> Add the key/value pair to the OP's storage startup dictionary. The storage element will take on this value when the file starts up.
> 
> * key - A string name for the storage startup entry.
> * value - The startup value/object to store.
> 
> ```
> n.storeStartupValue('sales5', 1) # 'sales5' will have a value of 1 when the file starts up.
> 
> ```

`unstoreStartupValue(keys1, keys2..)`→ `None`:

> For key, remove it from the OP's storage startup dictionary. Pattern Matching is supported as well. This does not affect the stored value, just its startup value.
> 
> * keys - The name or pattern defining which key/value pairs to remove from the storage startup dictionary.
> 
> ```
> n.unstoreStartupValue('sales*') # removes all entries from this OPs storage startup that start with 'sales'
> 
> ```

### Miscellaneous[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Miscellaneous")]

`__getstate__()`→ `dict`:

> Returns a dictionary with persistent data about the object suitable for pickling and deep copies.

`__setstate__()`→ `dict`:

TouchDesigner Build: Latest\nmw-blank2022.241402021.100002020.200002019.146502018.28070

Lets you embed files inside a `[.tox](-2.html ".tox")` or `[.toe](.html ".toe")` file. Operators like the Movie File In TOP that read regular files can also read the embedded VFS files using a `vfs:` syntax.

The Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.

Privacy of TouchDesigner Components (`.tox` files) or Projects (`.toe` files) is the protection of networks that enables them to be used but not be visible or editable.

A ParGroup is a group of related parameters that you can set and get as a whole instead of its individual parameters.

Indicator of certain states of an operator (bypass, display, lock, viewer active).

To re-compute the output data of the [Operators](Operator.html "Operator"). An operator cooks when (1) its inputs change, (2) its [Parameters](Parameter.html "Parameter") change, (3) when the timeline moves forward in some cases, or (4) [Scripting](Script.html "Script") commands are run on the node. When the operator is a [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component"), it also cooks when a user interacts with it. When an operator cooks, it usually causes operators connected to its output to re-cook. When TouchDesigner draws the screen, it re-cooks all the [Dependencies](Dependency.html "Dependency") - the necessary operators in all [Networks](Network.html "Network"), contributing to a frame's total "cook time".

A set of commands located in a Text DAT that are triggered to run under certain conditions. There are two scripting languages in TouchDesigner: [Python](Python.html "Python") and the original [Tscript](Tscript.html "Tscript"). Scripts and single-line commands can also be run in the [Textport](Textport.html "Textport").

Creates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the "for-loop" of operators. Unlike [Clone](Clone.html "Clone"), it automatically creates copies of a master component.

Storage is a python dictionary in each operator, where users can store and fetch extra data.

TouchDesigner's original built-in Command scripting language prior to [Python](Python.html "Python").

Matching names using wildcard characters and bracketing. Useful in "[Select](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP")" type parameters to select multiple operators, paths, channels, etc.

Actors Class - Derivative

# Actors Class

The Actors Class describes the set of all [Actor COMPs](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP") used by the [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP") and [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html "Nvidia Flex Solver COMP"). It can be accessed with a Bullet Solver COMP. It can be accessed much like a Python list.

```
actors = op('bsolver1').actors	# get the Actors object
print(len(actors))				# number of Actors 
print(actors[0])				# first Actor component in the list
for a in actors:
	print(a)					# print all Actors

```

No operator specific members.

Add SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Add SOP

The Add SOP can both create new Points and Polygons on its own, or it can be used to add Points and Polygons to an existing input.

If an input is specified, this SOP adds points and polygons to it as specified below. If no input is specified, then it generates the points and polygons below as a new entity. It can read points and vertices from DATs. See also [DAT to SOP](DAT_to_SOP.html "DAT to SOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[addSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/AddSOP_Class "AddSOP Class")

* [2 Parameters - Points Page](#Parameters_-_Points_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Polygons Page](#Parameters_-_Polygons_Page)
* [4 Parameters - Post Page](#Parameters_-_Post_Page)
* [5 Uses](#Uses)
* [6 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Points Page

Points DAT `pointdat` - Path to a [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") containing point data. By default, x, y, z, and w can be defined in the first 4 columns of the table using un-named columns.

If the `Named Attributes` parameter below is turned on, the following attributes can be defined in the Points Table DAT using named columns:

* `P(0) P(1) P(2) P(3)`
* `N(0) N(1) N(2)`
* `Cd(0) Cd(1) Cd(2) Cd(3)`
* `uv(0) uv(1) uv(2)`

Any other columns are added as single-float attributes.

**NOTE:** Turn off `Compute Normals` on the Polygon parameter page when supplying `N(0) N(1) N(2)` in the Points Table DAT.

Named Attributes `namedattribs` - Allows extra attributes to be defined in the Point Table DAT above.
Delete Geometry, Keep Points `keep` - Use this option to remove any unused points. When checked, existing geometry in the input are discarded, but the polygons created by this SOP are kept, as well as any points in the input.
Add Points `addpts` - When On you can add individual points with position and weight of your choosing by using the parameters below.
Point `point` - Sequence of points to add
Position `point0pos` - ⊞ - The three input fields represent the X, Y and Z coordinates of the point. These values can be constants (numbers) or variables. Below are three examples:
```
0.2    0.42    1.3

```
0.2    op('xform1').par.tx    1.36

# read the sixth point (first point is 0) from the SOP, grid1
op('grid1').points[5].x    op('grid1').points[5].y    op('grid1').points[5].z

* Position `point0posx` -

* Position `point0posy` -

* Position `point0posz` -

Weight `point0weight` - The spline weight of the point. If the point is later used to create a spline (nurbs or Bezier) primitive, the weight will influence the shape of the primitive and may cause that primitive to become rational. Polygons and metaballs are not affected by this weight.

## Parameters - Polygons Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - Specify to create polygons from the points by using a Group method or Pattern Method.

* By Group `group` - Create as many polygons as determined by the group field and by the grouping / skipping rules.

* By Pattern `pattern` - Specify the points to use to create polygons using the parameters Polygon Table or Polygon 0 below.

Group `group` - Subset of points to be connected.
Add `add` - ⊞ - Optionally join subgroups of points.

* All Points `all` - Adds all points just as if you added them manually in the Points page.

* Groups of N Points `group` - Adds only the number of points specified.

* Skip Every Nth Point `skip` - Adds points, buts skips every Nth one.

* Each Group Separately `sep` - Creates separate polygons for each group specified in the `Group` parameter. For example, if you have a Group SOP creating a group called group1 and using the `Create Boundary Groups` option, you can connect this to an Add SOP and enter group1\_\_\* in the `Group` parameter. If `Each Group Separately` is chosen, polygons will be created for each boundary on the surface.

**Tip: The Each Group Separately option is useful when pasting surfaces. Boundary groups can be created for the boundaries of two adjacent surfaces, and then the PolyLoft SOP (using the Points option) can be used to stitch these surfaces together.**

N `inc` - Increment / skip amount to use for adding points.
Closed `closedall` - Closes the generated polygons.
Polygons Table `polydat` - Path to a Table DAT containing polygon data. Accepts rows of polygons specified by point number in the first column. The second column indicates if the polygons are closed (1) or open (0).
Polygon `poly` - Sequence of polygon patterns
Pattern `poly0pattern` - Create a fixed number of polygons by specifying a point pattern for each polygon. Enter connection lists here to add polygons. These consist of a list of point numbers to define the order in which the points are to be connected. The form is: {from}-{to}[:{every}][,{of}].

Examples of Valid Connection Lists:

`1 2 3 4` - Makes a polygon by connecting point numbers 1,2,3,4.
`1 3-15 16 8` - All points from 3-15 are included.
`1-234 820-410 235-409` - Points from 1-820 are included, in the specified order.
`0-15:2` - Every other point from 0 to 15 is included.
`0-15:2,3` - Every 2 of 3 points are included (i.e. 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15).
`!4` - Every point except 4 is included.
`!100-200` - Every point <100 and >200 is included.
`*` - Include all points.
`9-0` - The first ten points are included in reverse order.
`!9-0` - All but the first ten points are included in reverse order.
Closed `poly0closed` - To create a closed polygon, check the Closed button.

## Parameters - Post Page

Remove Unused Points `remove` - Keep only the connected points, and discard unused points.
Compute Normals `normals` - Creates normals on the geometry.

## Uses

Used in conjunction with a point expression, the Add SOP can be useful for extracting a specific point from another SOP. For example, to extract the X, Y and Z value of the fifth point, from a Grid SOP in geo1:

```
op('geo1/grid1').points[5].x
op('geo1/grid1').points[5].y
op('geo1/grid1').points[5].z

Points added in this way are appended to the end of the point list if a Source is specified. Middle-mouse click on the SOP node to find out how many points there are. For example, if you have added two points and there are 347 points (from 0 to 346), you have added the last two point numbers: 345 and 346.

## Operator Inputs

* Input 0:  -

Extra Information for the Add SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Common SOP Info Channels

* num\_points - Number of points in this SOP.

* num\_prims - Number of primitives in this SOP.

* num\_particles - Number of particles in this SOP.

## Parameters - Transform Page

Fixed Layer `size` - ⊞ - The selected input will become the fixed layer and the other input will be the overlay. This does not change the order of the composite (Input1 + Input2), only which layer is considered fixed and which layer is adjustable by the parameters on the Transform page. The resolution and aspect ratio of the Fixed Layer is used as the composite's final resolution and aspect ratio unless manually on the [Common Page](#Parameters_-_Common_Page).

* Input 1 `input1` -

* Input 2 `input2` -

Pre-Fit Overlay `prefit` - ⊞ - Determines how the Overlay layer (Overlay layer is the input that is NOT the Fixed Layer) fills the composite.

* Fill `fill` - Overlay layer is stretched/squashed to fill the resolution and aspect ratio of the Fixed Layer.

* Fit Horizontal `fithorz` - Overlay layer is stretched/squashed to fit the Fixed Layer horizontally.

* Fit Vertical `fitvert` - Overlay layer is stretched/squashed to fit the Fixed Layer vertically.

* Fit Best `fitbest` - Overlay layer is stretch/squashed to fit the Fixed Layer using the best possible match that does not crop any of the Overlay layer. The aspect ratio of the Overlay is maintained.

* Fit Outside `fitoutside` - Overlay layer is stretched squashed to fit the Fixed Layer using the worst possible match. This is the opposite of Best Fit. The aspect ratio of the Overlay is maintained.

* Native Resolution `nativeres` - Overlay is not squashed or stretched. The Overlay layer uses its own resolution and aspect ratio during the composite. Pixel accurate composites require Native Resolution, use this setting for to maintain an image's original resolution during the composite.

Justify Horizontal `justifyh` - ⊞ - Specify the horizontal alignment of the Overlay.

* Left `left` - The Overlay is aligned to the left side of the Fixed Layer.

* Center `center` - The Overlay is centered in the Fixed Layer.

* Right `right` - The Overlay is aligned to the right side of the Fixed Layer.

Justify Vertical `justifyv` - ⊞ - Specify the vertical alignment of the Overlay.

* Bottom `bottom` - The Overlay is aligned to the bottom of the Fixed Layer.

* Top `top` - The Overlay is aligned to the top of the Fixed Layer.

Extend Overlay `extend` - ⊞ - Sets the extend (or repeat) conditions of the Overlay layer. This parameter determines what happens at the edges of the Overlay layer.

* Hold `hold` - The pixel values at the edges of the Overlay layer continue to extend past that edge.

* Zero `zero` - The image does not extend past the edges of the Overlay.

* Repeat `repeat` - The image is repeated at the edges of the Overlay.

* Mirror `mirror` - The image is mirrored at the edges of the Overlay.
> **NOTE:** All the transform parameters below affect the Overlay layer only.

Rotate `r` - Rotates the Overlay layer. Increasing values rotate clockwise, decreasing values rotate counter-clockwise.
Translate `t` - ⊞ - Translates the Overlay layer in x and y.

Translate Units `tunit` - Sets the units used in the Translate parameter.
Scale `s` - ⊞ - Scales the Overlay layer in x and y.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - Allows you to define the point about which the Overlay layer scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the Transform Order.

Pivot Units `punit` - Sets the units used in the Pivot parameter.

Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.

* Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

* Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.

* Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.

* Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

* W `resolutionw` -

* H `resolutionh` -

Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit>Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.

* Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.

* Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

* Aspect1 `aspect1` -

* Aspect2 `aspect2` -

Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

* Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.

* Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.

* Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses  [mipmap](Mipmapping.html "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.

**NOTE:**To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.

* Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.

* Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.

* Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.

* Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.

* Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.

* Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

* Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.

Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
Pixel Format `format` - ⊞ - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](Pixel_Formats.html "Pixel Formats") for more information.

* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's pixel format.

* 8-bit fixed (RGBA) `rgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel.

* sRGB 8-bit fixed (RGBA) `srgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace.

Alembic SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Alembic SOP

The Alembic SOP loads and plays back [Alembic](http://www.alembic.io/) file geometry sequences.

The supported Alembic primitives are polymesh, curves, and points for geometry. As well, Alembic transformations are supported.

For Alembic files that contain animation, use the Time parameter and pay attention to the Unit menu to control it in frames, seconds, or whatever you like.

An Alembic archive may contain one or more object paths for one or multiple geometries. It is possible to view these objects all at once or select them separately using the 'Object Path' parameter menu.

Each object in an Alembic file schema may possess standard or custom attributes. The standard attributes are normal (`N`), velocity (`V`), and texture coordinates (`UV`).
Multiple custom attributes may live in an Alembic schema with more flexible names and types. The custom attribute types can be any of the following:

* float arrays
* integer arrays
* 2d or 3d vectors of floats
* matrix with 16 float elements

The conversion between the Alembic geometries scopes to the TouchDesigner attributes types are shown in the table below:

|  | |
| --- | --- |
| **Alembic Scope** | **TouchDesigner Attribute** |
| Varying, Vertex | Point |
| Facevarying | Vertex |
| Uniform, Constant | Primitive |

The Alembic SOP lets you load geometry to either the CPU or the GPU.
While using the GPU is much faster, it has some limitations:

* In GPU direct mode you can not connect additional SOPs downstream.
* In GPU direct mode, when there are multiple objects with different sets of attributes, a default value is used for the missing attributes of each objects. For example, if one geometry has normal data and another one doesn’t, the x, y, and z elements of normal vector for the geometry with the missing normal attribute will be set to 0, 0, 1 respectively.

  + [3.2 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [3.3 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Page

Alembic File `file` - The file path to the Alembic file.
Object Path `objectpath` - Specify which geometry object to be loaded. Each geometry object can represent a hierarchies of multiple geometries. It is also possible to choose the "All Objects" option from the list of available objects. This option is selected by default.
Time `time` - Specify which part of the Alembic samples sequence is loaded. The time unit menu converts the current time units to the selected unit. The available options are Frames, Seconds, and Fraction.
Time Unit `timeunit` -
Transform `xform` - ⊞ - Select which transform is applied if the transform data is available from the input Alembic file.

* None `none` - No transformation is applied to the geometry(s), they reside at the origin.

* Static Local Transformation `transform` - Applies the static local transformation for the selected geometry objects from the Object Path.

* Static World Transformation `transform` - Applies the static world transformation of the selected geometry objects from the Object Path up to their parents transformation.

* Dynamic Transformation `transform` - In the case that the Alembic file includes dynamic or animated geometries the transformation is applied to the selected geometries. This option performs both local and world transformation (if available) for the given geometry.

Interpolation `interp` - ⊞ - Interpolate between the samples/keyframes in the Alembic file. This parameter only works if the selected geometries are defined as dynamic and the transformation information are available from the input Alembic file.

* None `none` - No interpolation is performed between each samples.

* Smooth Interpolation `interpT` - Smooth interpolation between each two samples is calculated.

Straight to GPU `straightgpu` - Load the geometry directly to the GPU. This options is much faster than the default loading to CPU, however you can not use the geometry output to other SOPs or access the geometry data in the [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") or [SOP to DAT](SOP_to_DAT.html "SOP to DAT"). It is recommended that the Alembic file have the normals and UVs baked into the file since you can not add them via SOPs in TouchDesigner.
Compute Normal `compnml` - Creates normals for the input geometry.
Unload `loadfile` - Toggling the unload to "on" will unload the file and close it. By setting it to "off", the file will be loaded again. When the file is unloaded it can be overwritten by other applications or deleted.

Extra Information for the Alembic SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific Alembic SOP Info Channels

Align SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Align SOP

The Align SOP aligns a group of primitives to each other or to an auxiliary input, by translating or rotating each primitive along any pivot point.

**Left and Right Primitives** - The notions of "left" and "right" which follow depend on context. If an auxiliary input is used, it is always the right primitive and the primary input geometry are all left primitives. If only one input is used, then for each pair being aligned, there is a left and a right primitive. This means that relative to neighbouring primitives, one primitive can be both left and right.

[![TouchGeometry72.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/2/25/TouchGeometry72.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry72.gif)

* [6 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [6.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group `group` - A subset of primitives to align (accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching in the [Scripting Guide](http://www.derivativeinc.com/Tools/Touch000/Manual/Guides/ScriptingGuide/ScriptingGuide.pdf)). If blank, it aligns the entire input.
Align `align` - ⊞ - Can optionally align subgroups of *n* primitives or every *n*th primitive in a cyclical manner.

* All Primitives `all` -

* Groups of N Primitives `group` -

* Skip Every Nth Primitive `skip` -

N `inc` - Determines the number of primitives to be either grouped or skipped.

Example: Assume there are six primitives numbered for 0 - 5, and N = 2. Then:

**a)**  
**b)**

## Parameters - Align Page

Bias `bias` - Determines which primitive remains unaffected: 0 Left, 1 Right.
Left UV `leftuv` - ⊞ - Pivot Location for each "left" primitive.

Right UV `rightuv` - ⊞ - Pivot location for each "right" primitive.

* U `rightuv1` -

* V `rightuv2` -

Right UV End `rightuvend` - ⊞ - If an auxiliary input is used, this location specifies an end point for the alignment. Left primitives are then distributed uniformly between the `Right UV` and the `Right UV End`.

* U `rightuvend1` -

* V `rightuvend2` -

Individual Alignment `individual` - Causes each primitive of the input to be aligned. If unchecked, only the first primitive is aligned and all others are placed relative to it, preserving the spatial layout of the left primitives.
Translate `dotrans` - When enabled, translates primitives during alignment by translating the left UV position to the right UV position.
Rotate `dorotate` - When enabled, rotates primitives during alignment by aligning the left UV tangents (at the left UV position) to the right UV tangents (at the right UV position).

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Sets the overall transform and rotation order for the transformations. The transform and rotation order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results using the exact same values.

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - Sets the overall transform and rotation order for the transformations. The transform and rotation order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results using the exact same values.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - Allows you to perform a post-alignment transformation. Specify the amount of translation about the local `xyz` axes.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - Allows you to perform a post-alignment transformation. Specify the amount of rotation about the local `xyz` axes.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - Allows you to perform a post-alignment transformation. Specify the amount of scaling about the local `xyz` axes.

  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Analyze Page

Function `function` - ⊞ - This menu determines the function applied to the channel.

* Average `average` - The average of the channel.

* Maximum `maximum` - The maximum value of the channel.

* Minimum `minimum` - The minimum value of the channel.

* Index of Maximum `maximumindex` -

* Index of Minimum `minimumindex` -

* Sum `sum` - The sum of all the samples in the channel.

* RMS Power `rmspower` - The RMS (root-mean-square) of the channel.

* Value of First Peak `firstpeakvalue` - The value of the first peak in the channel.

* Index of First Peak `firstpeakindex` - The index of the first peak in the channel. The index of the first sample is 0.

* Value of Last Peak `lastpeakvalue` -

* Index of Last Peak `lastpeakindex` -

* Value of Highest Peak `highestpeakvalue` - The value of the highest peak in the channel.

* Index of Highest Peak `highestpeakindex` - The index of the highest peak in the channel. If multiple samples have the same highest peak value, it returns the index of the last peak sample.

* Value of Lowest Peak `lowestpeakvalue` - The value of the lowest peak in the channel.

* Index of Lowest Peak `lowestpeakindex` - The index of the lowest peak in the channel. If multiple samples have the same lowest peak value, it returns the index of the last peak sample.

* Total Peaks `totalpeaks` - The total number of peaks in the channel.

* Duplicates `duplicates` - This will create two extra channels per input channel for total number of duplicates of a specific value (count) as well as first sample index that value appeared in the channel (index).

Allow Start Peaks `allowstart` - If the values of the first 2 samples are v0 and v1, if v0 > v1, count it as a peak. The default is to never count the first sample as a peak.
Allow End Peaks `allowend` - If the values of the last 2 samples are vn and vm, if vm > vn, count it as a peak. The default is to never count the last sample as a peak.
No Peak Value `nopeakvalue` - When no peaks are found, make this number (default is `-1`) the result that is output. When the Function is set to Peak Index or Peak Value, it is a way to detect that no peaks were found.
Analyze Valleys vs Peaks `valleys` - Analyze instead for the First Valley, Highest Valley, and Lowest Valley, when the corresponding Function menu options are chosen.

Analyze TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Analyze TOP

The Analyze TOP takes any image and determines various characteristics of it, such as the average pixel color, the pixel with the maximum luminance, or the min and max values in each channel. The result is stored in a 1x1, 1xN or Nx1 image depending on the chosen scope (See Scope parameter below). The calculated values can be brought into CHOPs using the [TOP to CHOP](TOP_to_CHOP.html "TOP to CHOP") node.

**Note:** When using the minimum and maximum operators, the default behaviour is to select the pixel with the highest value as chosen in the Analyze Channel parameter. For example, if Luminance is selected, the output will be the RGBA values of the pixel with the highest luminance, not the luminance value itself. Similarly, if a single channel is selected e.g. Red, Green, Blue, etc, then the output will be the pixel with the highest red value, rather than the highest values in each channel. To find the min or max values in each channel separately, set the Analyze Channel to RGBA Independent.

**Note:** When the operation is set to Count Pixels or Sum, the output image will default to a 32 bit floating point format in order to properly store the output data. For all other operations, the default output format will match the input format. The image format can be set manually using the parameter on the Common page.

**Note:** Using the Exclude NaNs or Mask features will slow down the performance of the node and should only be enabled if they are necessary.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[analyzeTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/AnalyzeTOP_Class "AnalyzeTOP Class")

Operation `op` - ⊞ - The operation to perform on the input image.

* Average `average` - Find the average value in each channel of the input image. This operation is notably slower when the Exclude NaNs or Mask features are used as the node must perform two passes to calculate the results.

* Minimum Pixel `minimum` - Find the pixel with the lowest value as determined by the 'Analyze Channel' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details.

* Maximum Pixel `maximum` - Find the pixel with the highest value as determined by the 'Analyze Channel' parameter. See Notes in the summary for more details.

* Count Pixels `count` - Calculates the number of valid pixels in the input image. By default, the output will be fixed based on the dimensions of the image as determined by the 'Scope' parameter e.g. Full Image = width\*height. When Exclude NaNs is enabled or a Mask is defined, the output will be the number of pixels that pass the mask and NaN checks. By default, when counting pixels the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format.

* Sum `sum` - Calculates the sum of all pixels in the input image by adding all of the values together. By default, the output image will be set to a 32bit floating point format in order to correctly store the output result.

* Minimum in RGB `minrgb` - Find the minimum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value.

* Minimum in RGBA `minrgba` - Find the minimum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same minimum value.

* Maximum in RGB `maxrgb` - Find the maximum value from the red, green and blue channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value.

* Maximum in RGBA `maxrgba` - Find the maximum value from the red, green, blue and alpha channels. All channels of the output will contain the same maximum value.

Analyze Channel `analyzechannel` - ⊞ - Determines what value the operation is being performed on. For example, when the operation is Minimum and the Analyze Channel is Red, the output will be the pixel with the lowest red value (not necessarily the lowest Blue or Green values). To separately find the lowest value in each channel, set this parameter to RGBA Independent.

* Luminance `luminance` - The output results are based on the luminance of the input pixels. Luminance is the relative intensity of the pixel based on the values in the RGB channels. Note: the output contains the original RGBA values of the pixel with the highest/lowest luminance, not the luminance value itself.

* Red `red` - Calculations are based only on the value in the red channel.

* Green `green` - Calculations are based only on the value in the green channel.

* Blue `blue` - Calculations are based only on the value in the blue channel.

* Alpha `alpha` - Calculations are based only on the value in the alpha channel.

* RGB Average `rgbaverage` - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGB channels.

* RGBA Average `average` - Calculations are based on the average value of the RGBA channels.

* RGBA Independent `independent` - Calculations are performed on each channels separately. Use this mode if you want to find the highest/lowest values in each channel.

* RGB Maximum `rgbmax` -

* RGBA Maximum `max` -

Scope `scope` - ⊞ - Determines how pixels are grouped together to calculate the results.

* Full Image `image` - Calculations are performed on all pixels of the input image and combined into a single pixel result.

* Rows `rows` - Calculations are performed on each row of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel wide and the same number of rows as the input.

* Columns `columns` - Calculations are performed on each column of the input separately, resulting in an output image that is one pixel tall and the same number of columns as the input.

Exclude NaNs `excludenans` - Enable this parameter to skip pixels with a NaN value in the input image. NaNs typically represent errors in previous calculations (such as dividing by zero), but they can also be used to represent invalid pixels in a point cloud image. When most operations encounter a NaN pixel, the resulting output will always be a NaN, so you must enable this parameter to get valid results. If you do not expect NaN values in your input, it is recommended to leave this parameter turned off since it will reduce performance.
Mask `mask` - ⊞ - This parameter allows you to exclude certain pixels based on the values in one or more channels in the input. For example, if set to Alpha, only pixels that have a non-zero value in the alpha will be included. This can be useful, for example, if you need to find the average position of a point cloud image that is using an Active channel to indicate which pixels store valid point data.

* None `none` - No mask channel. All pixels will be used in the output calculations.

* Red `red` - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the red channel will be used.

* Green `green` - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the green channel will be used.

* Blue `blue` - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the blue channel will be used.

* Alpha `alpha` - Only pixels with a non-zero value in the alpha channel will be used.

* RGBA Independent `independent` - Each channel will act as its own mask, so that only pixels will non-zero values will be used in the output calculations.

## Inside a CHOP[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Inside a CHOP")]

* A CHOP contains a set of **channels** defined over a **start-end interval**.
* The channels of a CHOP can represent **motion, MIDI, audio, color maps, rolloff curves** or **lookup tables**.
* Each channel is one **array of raw samples**, which is simply a list of numbers.
* Each channel of a CHOP has a **channel name** that can be set by the user.
* The group of CHOP channels is known as a **clip**.
* A **CHOP contains a clip plus control parameters, a sample rate, some on/off flags, and a start/end interval**.
* The CHOP can have any start/end indexes. All channels in a CHOP share the same start-end interval.
* The interval goes from the start position to the end position.
* The interval of a CHOP is not restricted to be the length of the animation.
* Each CHOP has a **sample rate**, used if the CHOP contains time-dependent motion or audio data.
* Audio has a high sample rates when compared to animated motion.

## CHOP Inputs, Parameters and Outputs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: CHOP Inputs, Parameters and Outputs")]

* CHOPs have "parameters" used to define the data, plus the data channels, which are input/output from the CHOP as its data stream.
* The CHOP parameters are usually constant-valued, but can be time-dependent expressions.
* Each CHOP receives channels at its inputs. When the CHOP cooks, the channels of the inputs are combined. The CHOP outputs the resulting channels to other CHOPs.
* CHOPs output their data channels as arrays of numbers, not interpolated segments. Some CHOPs retain interpolated segments internally, but all CHOPs always output their data as raw samples.
* If the CHOP's inputs are not changing and the control parameters are not time-dependent, the CHOP will be non-time-dependent and it will not cook every time the animation frame advances.
* Some CHOPs have Local Variables:  
   $I (the array index within the CHOP), $C (the channel number within the CHOP)
* Some CHOPs output or use CHOP attributes, such as channels grouped as quaternion rotation channels.

## Parts of a CHOP[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Parts of a CHOP")]

* Each CHOP has a set of parameters.
* CHOPs' parameters can be expressed in different units: samples (indexes), frames or seconds. These units are selected by the user in a menu to the right of such parameters.
* Each CHOP has flags: 
  + **The Graph** flag marks the CHOP to be displayed in the Graph of the CHOP Editor.
  + **The Export** flag causes the CHOP channels to override channels of objects, SOps.
  + **The Lock** flag causes the CHOP can be locked and hand-edited. The Channel Editor is the interactive editor of parameter channels in CHOPs.
  + **The Bypass** flag is a convenient way for a CHOP's effect to be disabled.
* Each CHOP has an info pop-up menu accessible by middle-mouse clicking on the CHOP. This lists channel names and values, sample rate and interval.
* Each CHOP has a comment field.

## CHOP Networks[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: CHOP Networks")]

* CHOPs are arranged in OP networks in components, where CHOP outputs are connected to the inputs of other CHOPs.

### Object, SOP and COP Channels Imported from CHOPs [[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Object, SOP and COP Channels Imported from CHOPs")]

Parameters of SOPs, TOPs and objects (components) are able to get values from CHOP channels with expressions like the following:

```
 chop(CHOPchannelpath)
 chopi(CHOPchannelpath, index

However, exporting is preferred where possible. It is faster and involves less typing.

### CHOPs Exported to Component, SOP and TOP Channels[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: CHOPs Exported to Component, SOP and TOP Channels")]

* CHOP data channels are exported to Components, SOPs, etc. to drive their parameters. CHOPs can be exported to any TouchDesigner parameter.
* Each CHOP has an Export flag (and an Export Prefix, infrequently used), causing the CHOP to attach its channels to Components, SOPs, TOPs and so on.
* The Export flag and Export Prefix are used to connect channels of an object or SOP directly to a CHOP. It uses automatic matching of channels names. For example, a CHOP "tx" channel could map to an Geometry Component's tx parameter.
* When a CHOP exports to an object, SOP or TOP, the latters' channels are said to be overridden. An OP's Override menu lists what is overridden.

## Channel Index and Value[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Anatomy_of_a_CHOP&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Channel Index and Value")]

[![ChannelsInfo2.gif](images/2/2b/ChannelsInfo2.gif)](File_ChannelsInfo2.html)

* The horizontal axis is called the i-axis or the index-axis.
* The vertical axis is called the v-axis or the value-axis.
* An index is a point along the i-axis,denoted by i.
* A value is a point along the v-axis, denoted by v.
* A sample is an index-value pair (i,v). i.e. the value of a channel at a certain index.
* A sample is made of a sample index and a sample value.
* An interval is an index range, which goes from a start index to an end index.
* A value range goes from a start value to an end value.
* The index duration is the end index minus the start index + 1.
* CHOP data channels are arrays of raw samples, in 32-bit floating point format.
* Channels in a CHOP may be control (parameter) channels or data channels. CHOPs manupulate the data channels.
* CHOPs can be evaluated at integer and non-integer indexes.
* Frame is used when the index corresponds to time.
* When speaking of animation frames, you can refer to start frame, end frame and frame range.

Animation COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Animation COMP

The Animation Component is a special component used for creating keyframe animation channels. The component contains a pre-defined network utilizing a [Keyframe CHOP](Keyframe_CHOP.html "Keyframe CHOP") and a number of [Table DATs](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") to define the animated [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") channels.

The [Animation Editor](Animation_Editor.html "Animation Editor") is the user interface for creating and editing the animation of the Animation Component.

The Animation Component has both in and out CHOP connectors.

**Animation Component Inputs**

With no input connected, the Animation Component's index loops over the time range of the channels.
The CHOP input can be used to manually control the index of the animated channels. For example, if the channels are keyed from frame 1 to 600, you can connect an input to the component and manually drive the animation output by feeding it a number between 1 and 600 (indexes outside the range will use the channel extend conditions).

Using the Keyframe CHOP's Index Units menu, you can drive the animation with numbers expressed in seconds, samples, or a fraction where 0 is the start and 1 is the end.

**Animation Component Outputs**

The CHOP output gives access to the animation channel's current value. CHOPs can be directly connected or a [Null CHOP](Null_CHOP.html "Null CHOP") may be appended for [exporting](CHOP_Export.html "CHOP Export") the channels to parameters. The current channel values can also be viewed by turning on the Animation Component's [node viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer").

### Using the Animation Component

Keyframing any parameter, attribute, or data in TouchDesigner begins with an Animation Component. You can create an Animation COMP from;

* The [OP Create Dialog](OP_Create_Dialog.html "OP Create Dialog")
* Right-click on any parameter of an OP. **RMB -> Keyframe Parameter in... -> New Animation** to create a new Animation COMP

To open the Animation Editor, right-click on an Animation COMP and select **Edit Animation...** to open that animation in the editor. You can also change any pane to **Animation Editor** type and the Editor will open whilst pointing to the last Animation COMP that was scoped.

Then you can create and keyframe animation channels. Refer to the [Animation Editor](Animation_Editor.html "Animation Editor") for instructions on keyframing.

[![AnimationCOMPEdit.png](images/a/af/AnimationCOMPEdit.png)](File_AnimationCOMPEdit.html)

## Parameters - Animation Page

Time Reference `timeref` - The location the Animation COMP looks to for its time information. This is used for default channel range and rate when the Type parameter on the Range page is set to **Timeline**.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Specifies the method used to playback the animation or allows the output the entire animation curve.

* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline. Scrubbing or jumping in the timeline will change the animation position accordingly. The parameters Play, Speed, Cue, and Cue Point are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly controlling the animation's position.

* Use Input Index `input` - This mode allows the user to specify a particular position in the animation using the index input on the Animation COMP (the CHOP input to the Animation COMP). The Input Index Unit parameter can be used to change the units of the input channel. Use this mode for random access to any location in the animation for maximum flexibility.

* Sequential `sequential` - This mode continually plays regardless of the timeline position (the Index parameter is disabled). Reset and Speed parameters below are enabled to allow some control.

* Output Full Range `outputrange` - This option outputs the entire animation channel range. This is useful for using the Animation COMP to create custom lookup curves/channels.

Play `play` - Animation plays when On and stops when Off. This animation playback control is only available when Play Mode is *Sequential*.
Speed `speed` - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is *Sequential*. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on. Negative values will play the animation backwards.
Cue `cue` - Jumps to Cue Point when set to 1. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.
Cue Pulse `cuepulse` - Instantly jumps to the Cue Point.
Cue Point `cuepoint` - Set any index in the animation as a point to jump to. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.
Cue Point Unit `cuepointunit` - Units used when setting the Cue Point parameter.
Input Index Unit `inputindexunit` - ⊞ - When Play Mode is set to **Use Input Index** use this menu to choose the units for the index input channel. For example, choose between setting the index with frames or seconds. The Units X option sets the index to use the key information directly from the key DAT table inside the Animation COMP, disregarding any custom settings found in the attributes DAT table.

* Samples `samples` -

* Frames `frames` -

* Seconds `seconds` -

* Fraction `fraction` -

* X Units `xunits` -

Cyclic Range `cyclic` - ⊞ - Adapts the range of the animation for cyclic or non-cyclic input indices. When using a cyclic input index the lookup value for index 0.0 and 1.0 result in the same value. To avoid this, set Cyclic Range to Yes and the lookup will cycle smoothly.

* Automatic `auto` - Checks the right extend condition of each channel (Assumes type cycle and mirror are cyclic lookups).

* Yes `yes` - Cycles the output when index is outside the animation range.

* No `no` - Does not cycle the output when index is outside the animation range.

Specify Edit Attributes `specifyedit` - Turn this on to enable the edit attributes parameter below.
Edit Origin `editorigin` - Changes the origin of the animation channel edits. This does not change the data stored in the key DAT table, but it does effect the channels display in the graph and playback of the animation.
Edit Rate `editrate` - Changes the rate of the animation channel edits. This does not change the data stored in the key DAT table, but it does effect the channels display in the graph and playback of the animation.
Edit Animation... `editanimation` - Clicking this button will open this Animation COMP in the Animation Editor.

## Parameters - Range Page

Type `rangetype` - ⊞ - Set the working range for the Animation COMP.

* Timeline `timeline` - Uses the range set in the timeline specified by the Time Reference parameter on the previous Animation parameter page.

* Custom `custom` - Set a custom range using the Start and End parameters below.

Start `start` - Start of the Custom range, expressed in units seconds, frames or samples.
Start Unit `startunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
End `end` - End of the Custom range, expressed in units seconds, frames or samples.
End Unit `endunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Trim Left `tleft` - ⊞ - Determines the output of the channels when past the 'End' position. Does not affect Play Mode = Output Full Range, to manipulate the [Extend Conditions](Extend_Conditions.html "Extend Conditions") of that mode adjust the Extend parameters of the [Keyframe CHOP](Keyframe_CHOP.html "Keyframe CHOP") inside the Animation COMP.

* Hold `hold` - Hold the current value of the channel.

* Slope `slope` - Continue the slope before the start of the channel.

* Cycle `cycle` - Cycle the channel repeatedly.

* Mirror `mirror` - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.

* Default Value `default` - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

Trim Right `tright` - ⊞ - Determines the output of the channels when before the 'Start' position. Does not affect Play Mode = Output Full Range, to manipulate the [Extend Conditions](Extend_Conditions.html "Extend Conditions") of that mode adjust the Extend parameters of the [Keyframe CHOP](Keyframe_CHOP.html "Keyframe CHOP") inside the Animation COMP.

* Slope `slope` - Continue the slope after the end of the channel.

Trim Default `tdefault` - The value used for the Default Value trim conditio above.

Extra Information for the Animation COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Annotate COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Annotate COMP

Annotates are displayed in the Network Editor as colored rectangles containing user-authored text and graphics. It is based on the Annotate COMP and allows you to document your networks with useful information like comments and node grouping.

There are three built-in forms of the Annotate COMP: [Comments, Network Boxes, and Annotates](Network_Utilities__Comments%2c_Network_Boxes%2c_Annotates.html "Network Utilities: Comments, Network Boxes, Annotates") that can be easily created:

* **[Comments](Network_Utilities__Comments%2c_Network_Boxes%2c_Annotates.html "Network Utilities: Comments, Network Boxes, Annotates")** are simple, text-only post-it notes. They can be created via the network RMB menu or with the shortcut Shift-C
* **[Network Boxes](Network_Utilities__Comments%2c_Network_Boxes%2c_Annotates.html "Network Utilities: Comments, Network Boxes, Annotates")** group nodes together for labeling/dragging. They can be created via the network RMB menu or with the shortcut Shift-B
* **[Annotates](#Default_Setup)** (Default Setup) do all of the above and incorporate a powerful node-viewing feature. They can be created via the network RMB menu, with the shortcut Shift-A, by holding Alt and left-dragging in the network, or by selecting Annotate from the COMP family in the [OP Create Dialog](OP_Create_Dialog.html "OP Create Dialog").

## Default Setup

The default setup of Annotate COMPs is a full-featured comment, network box, and node viewer, designed to be a flexible network organization and documentation tool. The following features are built using internal nodes and an extension and are not inherent parts of the Annotate COMP itself.

The **lock icon** in the top-right of the box locks and unlocks text editing in the Annotate. In a locked Annotate, you cannot edit text and clicking on the body area clicks through to the network below. Annotates also have a **RMB menu** for quick access to many features. It is always accessible through the title bar, and accessible through the body when the Annotate is unlocked.

You can **size** Annotates by dragging the edges and **move** them by dragging the title bar. In Comment mode, which has no title bar, you can drag the Annotate by the text body. When the **Enclose OPs** feature is on, dragging an Annotate will **drag all enclosed nodes** (including other Annotates) with it. To drag an annotate without dragging its contents, you can hold down Alt while dragging.

Annotates have powerful built-in **Operator Viewer features**, including positioning and interaction, which can be controlled using [Parameters - OP Viewer Page](#Parameters_-_OP_Viewer_Page). For basic **text features** see [Parameters - Text Page](#Parameters_-_Text_Page). For deeper **text editing and color features** including limiting text width, wrapping, and more, see [Parameters - Settings Page](#Parameters_-_Settings_Page).

Annotates are **layered in the network** so that smaller boxes are in front of larger boxes, but you have more control with the Depth Layer parameter. Annotates are positioned behind the grid by default, but you can put them in front of the grid, or even on top of the nodes tiles. For example, put an image with transparency in the Viewer OP and turn Back Color Alpha to 0, then set Layer Zone to be Above Nodes.

Because the Enter shortcut and zoom-to-enter are disabled in Annotates, to **get inside an Annotate**, use one of the following methods:

1. Box-pick an Annotate, then right-click on the network and select "Jump Down".
2. Find the Annotate via the path bar at the top of the network pane.
3. Box-pick an Annotate, right-click on the "i" icon on the Parameter Dialog and select Enter Annotation from the node menu.

You can switch between the three built-in Annotate modes by using the Mode parameter of the Annotate COMP or the **Mode** menu in the right-click menu.

Anti Alias TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Anti Alias TOP

The Anti-Alias TOP uses a screen space antialiasing technique called ‘SMAA: Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing’. Detailed information here: <http://www.iryoku.com/smaa/> It uses an image’s luminance, color or a depth map to detect edges of objects and then applies anti-aliasing to those edges. The current implementation does not yet use the temporal features of it, so each image is individually anti-aliased without requiring knowledge of other frames. It doesn’t require the extra memory that regular Render TOP anti-aliasing does, and avoids work involved with antialiasing polygon edges that are ultimately occluded by another object.

Arm SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Arm SOP

The Arm SOP creates all the necessary geometry for an arm, and provides a smooth, untwisted skin that connects the arm to the body. It is controlled through inverse kinematics linked to a handprint.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[armSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ArmSOP_Class "ArmSOP Class")

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Arm Page](#Parameters_-_Arm_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Lengths Page](#Parameters_-_Lengths_Page)
* [4 Parameters - Transforms Page](#Parameters_-_Transforms_Page)
* [5 Parameters - End Affector Page](#Parameters_-_End_Affector_Page)
* [6 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [6.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Arm Page

Capture Type `capttype` - ⊞ - You can use either **Ellipses** or **Capture Regions** as deformation geometry. Ellipses are for use with the Skeleton SOP. Capture Regions are for use with the Capture SOP.

* Ellipses `ellipses` -

* Capture Regions `cregions` -

Arm Axis `axis` - ⊞ - Position the model along the +X or -X axis.

* + X `posx` -

* - X `negx` -

Radius `bonerad` - Controls the scale of the circle radii.
Rotate Hand `rotatehand` - This parameter rotates the hand and the wrist joint to match the orientation of the hand-print object. In order to operate correctly, the end-affector (hand print) scale transformations must remain at 1.

**Note:** If the channel is set to 0, then the hand rotations are relative to the forearm. If the channel is set to 1, the hand rotations are the same orientation as the end affector.

Auto Elbow Twist `autoelbow` - This parameter affects the default twist of the elbow joint to a more natural position.
Elbow Twist `elbowtwist` - Specifies the rotation angle of the elbow joint.
Flip Elbow `flipelbow` - This toggle positions the arm using an alternative elbow position solution.

## Parameters - Lengths Page

[![TouchGeometry216.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/9/9e/TouchGeometry216.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry216.gif)
Clavicle `clavlength` - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.
Humerous `humlength` - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.
Ulna `ulnalength` - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.
Hand `handlength` - Control bone lengths, as illustrated above.
Shoulder Joint `shoulder` - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.
Elbow Joint `elbow` - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.
Wrist Joint `wrist` - Control the joint lengths, as illustrated above.

When the arm is positioned to reach the end affector (hand print), the shoulder, elbow and wrist joints may produce unnatural looking bends. The transform fields allow manual adjustment of each controlling circle of each joint to fix this.

Each joint circle (e.g. Shoulder 1) is given three transform fields (two translates and one scale). These values are scaled by the amount of bend applied to the particular joint. In other words, when the arm is fully extended, the transforms have no effect. When the arm joint angles are at 90, they have maximum effect. Thus, set the joints to 90 before adjusting these values.

Attribute CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Attribute CHOP

The Attribute CHOP adds, removes or updates attributes of the input CHOP. Currently there is only one attribute type, a "quaternion". This attribute type is used to group rotation channel triplets (rx,ry,rz) together.

Rotations sometimes need to be grouped together since interpolations on independent X, Y and Z rotations do not produce smooth results. Rotations often need Quaternion interpolation to rotate through the most direct path.

Operations such as resampling and blending recognize the rotation triplet with the "quaternion" attribute. They blend or resample the rotation channels using "spherical linear interpolation". Ordinary interpolation can produce poor blending results, whereas quaternion blending produces the shortest rotation path between two sets of rotations.

See some of the CHOPs that use the attribute: the [Join CHOP](Join_CHOP.html "Join CHOP"), [Composite CHOP](Composite_CHOP.html "Composite CHOP") and [Interpolate CHOP](Interpolate_CHOP.html "Interpolate CHOP"). Other CHOPs may quietly use the Quaternion attribute, such as the [Object CHOP](Object_CHOP.html "Object CHOP"), [Stretch CHOP](Stretch_CHOP.html "Stretch CHOP") and the [Resample CHOP](Resample_CHOP.html "Resample CHOP").

The Scope is needed to specify the channels that will be grouped.

Attribute Class - Derivative

# Attribute Class

An [Attribute](Attribute.html "Attribute") describes a general geometric Attribute, associated with a [Prim Class](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class"), [Point Class](Point_Class.html "Point Class"), or [Vertex Class](Vertex_Class.html "Vertex Class").
Specific values for each Prim, Point or Vertex are described with the [AttributeData Class](AttributeData_Class.html "AttributeData Class").
Lists of attributes for the [SOP](SOP_Class.html "SOP Class") are described with the [Attributes Class](Attributes_Class.html "Attributes Class").

`owner` → `OP` **(Read Only)**:

> The [OP](OP_Class.html "OP Class") to which this object belongs.

`name` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The name of this attribute.

`size` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> The number of values associated with this attribute. For example, a normal attribute has a size of 3.

`type` → `float | int | str | tuple | [TDU.Position](Position_Class.html "Position Class") | [TDU.Vector](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class")` **(Read Only)**:

> The type associated with this attribute: float, integer, string, tuple, [Position](Position_Class.html "Position Class"), or [Vector](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class").

`default` → `float | int | str | tuple | [TDU.Position](Position_Class.html "Position Class") | [TDU.Vector](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class")` **(Read Only)**:

> The default values associated with this attribute. Dependent on the type of attribute, it may return a float, integer, string, tuple, [Position](Position_Class.html "Position Class"), or [Vector](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class").

> Destroy the attribute referenced by this object.
> 
> ```
> n = scriptOP.pointAttribs['N'].destroy()
>

`vals(delayed=False)`→ `list`:

> Returns the attribute values as a list.
> 
> * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to vals(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately.

Attribute SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Attribute SOP

The Attribute SOP allows you to manually rename and delete point, vertex, and primitive attributes.

The top portion of each parameter page deals with the deleting of a specifc type of attributes.

For example: `Cd Alpha`

[Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") - Deletion accepts general pattern matching when determining which attributes to delete. For example:

> `*` = Delete all attributes  
> `Cd` = Delete the Cd attribute  
> `Cd Alpha` = Delete Cd & Alpha attributes  
> `a*` = Delete all attributes beginning with *a*  
> `* ^Cd` = Delete all attributes except Cd

**Note:** You should never delete just one of the following attributes, but always keep/delete them together. This is because TouchDesigner's capture/deform system expects these three attributes to occur together. Deleting a subset of the three will cause errors as they are interdependent:
`pCapt (point attribute), pCaptPath, pCaptData (detail attribute)`

See also: [Attribute Create SOP](Attribute_Create_SOP.html "Attribute Create SOP").

The next section of each page deals with renaming attributes. Specify the name of the original incoming attribute in the 'From Attribute' parameter, and the new name you want it renamed to in the 'To Attribute' parameter.

Audio Band EQ CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Band EQ CHOP

The Audio Band EQ CHOP is a 16-band [equalizer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio)) which filters audio input channels in the same way that a conventional band (graphic) equalizer uses a bank of sliders to filter fixed-frequency bands of sound.

The CHOP has 16 bands from 25 Hz to 22 kHz with one parameter per band. The bandwidth per band is approximately half the frequency between the prior and next bands.

See [Audio Filter CHOP](Audio_Filter_CHOP.html "Audio Filter CHOP"), [Audio Para EQ CHOP](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Para EQ CHOP"), [Audio Dynamics CHOP](Audio_Dynamics_CHOP.html "Audio Dynamics CHOP"), [Audio Spectrum CHOP](Audio_Spectrum_CHOP.html "Audio Spectrum CHOP")

Audio Binaural CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Binaural CHOP

The Audio Binaural CHOP uses the [Steam Audio API](https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/) to convert from multi-channel speaker-based audio (eg. stereo, quadraphonic, 5.1, 7.1, etc.) to binaural using [HRTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function)-based binaural rendering. The HRTF used is the default provided by Steam Audio.

The Audio Binaural CHOP is useful for converting audio from a variety of formats to a 2-channel binaural format that is VR-friendly.

The sample rate of the output is determined by the audio source, which must be either 44100 or 48000.

Audio Device Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Device Out CHOP

The Audio Device Out CHOP sends audio to any of the attached audio output devices using DirectSound/CoreAudio or ASIO.
The second input on the Audio Device Out CHOP can be used for volume control.

**Tip**: If you get audio popping or audio dropouts, it may be caused by your actual frame rate of your main `timeline` - some frames may take too long to compute/render. See [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing"). There are four possible remedies:

* The global CHOP [Maximum Time Slice Size](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") may be shorter than your worst-case time steps. Its default is .2 seconds set in Edit -> Preferences -> CHOPs -> Maximum Time Slice Size). If any frame takes longer than the Maximum Time Slice Size time to draw, audio will pop.
* Then the audio buffer size can be increased (the Buffer Length parameter defaults to .15 seconds) up to the Maximum Time Slice Size.
* Optimize your networks so under no condition your frame time exceeds the audio buffer size or the maximum time slice size. You can monitor this precisely with the [Perform CHOP](Perform_CHOP.html "Perform CHOP").
* Put audio in a separate TouchDesigner process.

## Parameters - Audio Device Out Page

Active `active` - Turns the audio output on or off.
Driver `driver` - ⊞ - Select between default DirectSound/CoreAudio or ASIO drivers.

* DirectSound `default` - The default Windows audio driver (a.k.a. WDM) or macOS CoreAudio driver, depending on your OS.

Device `device` - A menu of available audio devices to output to. Selecting *default* sets the audio device to that which is selected in Windows Control Panel>Sounds and Audio Devices>Audio>Sound Playback.
Error if Missing `errormissing` - The CHOP will error if the specified device is not found.
Outputs `outputs` - When Driver is set to ASIO on Windows or CoreAudio on macOS, this parameter lets you pick which output channels to use.
Buffer Length `bufferlength` - The length of the audio buffer in seconds. Audio output is delayed by this amount. For example, if the Buffer Length is 0.25 then the sound will occur 250ms = 0.25 seconds later than this CHOP received it (to keep the buffer full). If you hear crackling or popping in the audio output, try increasing this value.
Adjust Speed `adjustspeed` - This value controls how forcefully the output queue is modified when it grows too long or too short. A larger value recovers the queue size more quickly, but results in audible pitch changes.
Volume `volume` - 0 = mute, 1 = full volume.
Pan `pan` - 0 = left, 0.5 = centered, 1 = right.
Clamp Output `clampoutput` - Clamps the output between -1 and 1 to avoid clipping and overdriving of the audio system.
Cycle Channels in Output  - When True the audio channels are sent to each audio output such that no outputs are left silent. For example this allows a single channel to be output on two stereo outputs. (ASIO only).
Cook Every Frame `cookalways` - Forces the CHOP to cook every frame. This should be checked on at all times when outputing audio. It can be turned off when the CHOP is not in use.

## Parameters - Output 1 Page

When using DirectSound on Windows, outputs on this page and the following Output 2 page are for routing to an audio device's different speaker outputs. Not all devices will support all outputs.

When the Audio Device Out CHOP has multiple input channels, the channels are applied to the checked speaker outputs in order. The first input channel is output to the first speaker checked, the second input channel is output to the second speaker checked, and so on.

The following speaker outputs are found on this parameter page:

Stereo Mode `stereo` - Set to simple stereo left/right output mode.
Front Left `frontleft` - Enable this output if available.

# Audio Dynamics CHOP

The Audio Dynamics CHOP is designed to control the dynamic range of an audio signal. Dynamic range refers to how loud and quiet the audio is over some period of time. The Operator contains two types of dynamic control: compression and limiting.
It is recommended that you [link](Link.html "Link") this CHOP to an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP"), so that you can have some visual feedback: The amount of compression or limiting which is being applied will be displayed in the Info CHOP.

**Compressor**
The goal of a compressor is to reduce the amplitude of a signal when it crosses a certain threshold, while introducing little to no harmonic distortion. The desired threshold is set by the user, and the amount of compression to be applied is determined by the compression ratio. The attack and release parameters determine how quickly the compression will be applied and released, as incoming signal goes above and below the threshold.

**Limiter**
The purpose of a limiter is to ensure a signal is within a certain dynamic range, while introducing as little harmonic distortion as possible. Unlike the compressor, the goal is not to apply a smooth or musical form of dynamic control, but instead to keep the signal within a 'safe' range that is compatible with any CHOPS that are downstream (for example, an Audio Device Out). This means that the Limiter has a much more abrupt (instant) attack value, which cannot be adjusted by the user.

Input 2: **Side Chain Channels** - Other audio channels coming in can be used to determine the gains that are applied to the audio channels of the first input.

**NOTE**: This is a useful article for procedurally [mixing audio for games](http://gameaudionoise.blogspot.co.uk/p/all-in-mix-importance-of-real-time.html).

## Parameters - Pre Page

Input Gain (dB) `inputgain` - This parameter controls the volume of the channel before it reaches the compressor. If the signal to be compressed is not in a useful dynamic range, this parameter can be used to repair it.

## Parameters - Compressor Page

Enable Compressor `enablecompressor` - Turns the compressor on or off.
Compression Type `compressiontype` - ⊞ - Determines which compression method to use.

* Automatic Gain Control `compagc` - This type of compression is suitable for passages of audio which are varying in amplitude over an extended period of time. To apply this type of compression, set the threshold to a value which is near the maximum volume that you want to hear. Apply a large compression ratio (around 1.0), and set the attack and release to high values. As the passage of audio crosses the threshold value, compression will slowly be applied, and if set properly, the signal will be compressed to a constant range. Setting the attack and release too low will cause the output volume to waver too quickly, while high values may cause the compression to be applied too slowly.

* Musical Dynamics `compmus` - If a passage of vocals or a musical instrument is varying in amplitude and needs to be brought into a uniform dynamic range, try applying this type of compression. Unless a heavy compression sound is desired, it is best to use this effect lightly. Set the threshold into the volume range that you want to compress and apply a low compression ratio. Try different values of attack and release until you achieve a good dynamic balance.

Channel Linking `chanlinkingcomp` - ⊞ - As various channels come into the CHOP, they can either be compressed by an equal amount, or individually. If they are compressed equally, all of the channels will be evaluated for the highest peak value, and this value will be used to determine the compression amount.

If they are compressed separately, each channel will be evaluated and compressed by different amounts.

* Compress Equally `compequally` -

* Compress Individually `compindividually` -

Threshold (dB) `thresholdcompressor` - This parameter sets the threshold value which a signal must cross before compression is applied. It uses a decibel scale, where '0 decibels' would be considered the loudest possible signal\*, and '-60 decibels' would be nearly inaudible. This is assuming that input signals are normalized to a "-1 to +1" range.
Ratio `ratiocompressor` - The ratio is the amount of compression that will be applied to the signal, with respect to how far the signal has gone past the threshold value. A ratio of '0' will apply no compression. A value of '1' will cause a signals amplitude to be held down to the threshold value. With values over '1', the signal will become quieter as it passes the threshold.
Knee `kneecompressor` - The knee defines how the CHOP will transition into compression as signals approach or cross the threshold. With a knee of '0' (a hard knee), think of the compressor as applying a flat compression response, where:

compression\_gain(db) = amount\_that\_signal\_has\_crossed\_threshold(dB) \* compression\_ratio
This type of compression is not always desirable, as it can have a strong effect upon the dynamics of a sound. Increasing the knee parameter will cause there to be a smoothed transition into the compression.
See the Knee diagram below.

[![AudioKnee.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/thumb/4/43/AudioKnee.png/300px-AudioKnee.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:AudioKnee.png)

Attack (msec=10\*\*val) `attackcompressor` - The attack will control how quickly the compressor responds when a signal crosses the threshold. Increasing the attack parameter will cause the compressor to apply compression at a slower and smoother rate. Increasing the parameter too much, will cause compression to be applied too slowly.
Release (msec=10\*\*val) `releasecompressor` - The release will control how quickly the compressor responds when a signal drops to a lower level, or goes below the threshold altogether. Just like the attack, higher value will slow down the response, but too high of a value will be too slow.
Output Gain (dB) `gaincompressor` - After applying compression, the signal can be reduced with Gain to a lower volume level. To make up the lost volume, this parameter can be increased.

## Parameters - Limiter Page

Enable Limiter `enablelimiter` - Turns the limiter on or off.
Channel Linking `chanlinkinglim` - ⊞ - Same as compressor.

* Limit Equally `compequally` -

* Limit Individually `compindividually` -

Threshold (dB) `thresholdlimiter` - This is the threshold value which a signal must cross before limiting is applied. Usually, this value should be left at '0' decibels. Just like the compressor, a value of '0' decibels is considered to be the loudest possible signal.

From the perspective of digital audio, a signal level which varies between "+1 <-> -1" is at a volume level of "0" decibels, because it is not possible for a digital system to respresent any values larger than "+1 <-> -1". Instead, they will simply be clipped as they proceed to the output device. The limiter allows you to stop your audio from being clipped if you exceed this range, and applies a much smoother form of fast compression, which is barely audible.
Lowering the threshold value will cause the output to be clamped to a lower level.

Release (msec=10\*\*val) `releaselimiter` - Although the attack of a limiter is always quick, the release can still be set by the user. This will determine how long the limiter takes to transition out of a limiting situation. Increasing the release will help smooth out the effect of the limiter. Too high of a value may cause the limiter to release too slowly. For example, after an excessively loud tone burst, the limiter's gain may have been pushed up to an extreme value. This extreme value will take a long time to be fully released.

Each channel can be different by putting expressions with the channel index, `me.channelIndex` in parameters like the frequency channel.

Knee `kneelimiter` - Similar to the compressor, this parameter controls how the CHOP will transition into limiting, when a signal becomes louder. A larger knee will mean a smoother transition. See the Knee diagram above.

If set to '0', no limiting will be applied until a signal goes over the threshold value. When increasing the knee parameter, some limiting will be applied before a signal goes beyond the threshold value, in an attempt to smooth out the effects of limiting overall.

Dry / Wet Mix `drywet` - As this parameter is reduced from 1 (Wet) toward 0 (Dry), it removes the effect of the filter.

* `compressor_multiplier` - the amount that the compressor reduced the loudness. 1 means no-change. expressed not in dB – linear
* `limiter_multiplier` - the amount that the limiter reduced the loudness. not db – linear
* `compressor_db` - same as above but expressed in decibels
* `limiter_db`
* `compressor_attack_msec` - this is in milliseconds, computed from the parameter which is 1 msec at value 1 and 100,000 msec at value 5 (10\*\*val)
* `compressor_release_msec`
* `limiter_release_msec`

Audio File In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio File In CHOP

The Audio File In CHOP reads audio from files on disk or at `http://` addresses. File types `.mp3`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.au`, and `.wav` files are supported. It always outputs time sliced audio data. If you want to record the data, use a [Record CHOP](Record_CHOP.html "Record CHOP") or [Movie File Out TOP](Movie_File_Out_TOP.html "Movie File Out TOP").

See [Audio Movie CHOP](Audio_Movie_CHOP.html "Audio Movie CHOP") for reading from movie files. See [OSC In CHOP](OSC_In_CHOP.html "OSC In CHOP") for receiving audio streams via OSC.

For large files the Audio File In CHOP streams the file from disk so loading the entire file into memory is not needed.

* It streams files from disk and from `http:` locations (latter copies to local disk first) - It only keeps a few seconds in memory at a time.
* The supported audio files are `.mp3 .aif .aiff .wav` and other [audio formats](File_Types.html "File Types").
* It also plays audio-only from any movie files that TouchDesigner supports, like `.mov, .mpg .mp4`. See also the [Audio Movie CHOP](Audio_Movie_CHOP.html "Audio Movie CHOP") for playing audio from movie files in sync with their video.
* Audio files can be dragged/dropped onto TouchDesigner, double-clicked (if preferred), and RMB Open With... TouchDesigner.

Trim Start Unit `trimstartunit` - Units used for the Trim Start parameter.
Trim End `trimend` - Sets an **Out** point from the end of the audio, allowing you to trim the ending position of the audio stream. The units menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, or seconds.
Trim End Unit `trimendunit` - Units used for the Trim End parameter.
Pre-Read Length `prereadlength` - The amount of audio to buffer to maintain smooth playback. This will slightly impact memory usage, but does **not** create any delay in the audio.
Pre-Read Length Unit `prereadlengthunit` - Units used for the Pre-Read Length parameter.
Open Timeout `opentimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for the audio file to open. If the Open Timeout time is reached, the Audio File In CHOP will stop waiting, and play silence. If the file still isn't opened the next time the CHOP cooks, it'll wait again, and do the same. It'll keep doing this until the file is opened, or the open fails.
Mono `mono` - Output mono channel only even if file has multiple channels.
Volume `volume` - Set the level the file is read in at. A setting of 1 is full signal while 0 is muted.

Audio Filter CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Filter CHOP

The Audio Filter CHOP removes low frequencies, high frequencies, both low and high, or removes a mid-frequency range.

A Low pass filter removes the higher frequencies of a sound, while a high pass filter reduces the bass of the sound. A band pass filter is used to extract a frequency range (i.e. extracting a person's voice from background noise) and a band reject filter is used to cut out a frequency range.

If a certain frequency lies outside the pass band, sounds at that frequency will be reduced in magnitude. The farther outside the pass band the frequency is, the more it will be reduced.

The Cutoff frequency is also known as the "half-power" frequency. A wave at the cutoff frequency will be reduced to half power.

The Rolloff of a filter determines how quickly the drop occurs at its Cutoff frequencies. A low rolloff will produce a gradual filter falloff (more of the sounds outside the frequency range are heard), and a high rolloff will produce a sharp filter falloff.

Refer to [audio filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_filter) for more insight.

You can see the effects of the Audio Filter CHOP by passing it white noise from an Oscillator CHOP and sending the result to an Audio Spectrum CHOP. The Audio Filter CHOP is implemented with a 4-pole filter internally.

Moving the Dry / Wet parameter to Dry will bring back the incoming signal un-affected.

## Parameters - Filter Page

Filter `filter` - ⊞ - The filter type:

* Low Pass `lowpass` - All frequencies below the High Cutoff are passed through the filter (the "pass band").

* High Pass `highpass` - All frequencies above the Low Cutoff are passed through.

* Band Pass `bandpass` - All frequencies between the Low and High Cutoff are passed through.

* Band Reject `bandreject` - All frequencies above the High Cutoff and below the Low Cutoff are passed though.

Cutoff Units `units` - ⊞ - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed in Hz (menu set to Frequency) or power-of-10 (menu set to Logarithmic). It enables one of the next 2 Filter Cutoff parameters.

* Logarithmic `logarithmic` -

* Frequency `frequency` -

Filter Cutoff (Hz=10\*\*val) `cutofflog` - The filter cutoff frequency expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Filter Cutoff (Hz) `cutofffrequency` - The filter cutoff frequency expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Filter Resonance `resonance` - Increasing the resonance will boost the loudness of the passed frequencies near the cutoff frequency.
Roll-Off (dB per Octave) `rolloff` - Rolloff determines how much the levels decrease near the cutoff frequency. This parameter will make it decrease by 12 [decibels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) (dB) per octave, to, more extremely, 24 decibels per octave. 12 and 24 decibels correspond to levels of about 1/4 and 1/16.
Dry / Wet Mix `drywet` - As this parameter is reduced from 1 (Wet) toward 0 (Dry), it removes the effect of the filter.

## Cutoff Modulation Channels Input

The second input is the **Cutoff Modulation Channels**, which allows the filter parameters to be changed within the CHOP's time slice interval (typically 1/60 sec). This prevents audible stepping of the parameters that you are changing quickly.

You can send in a channel called `cutofffrequency` to override the value of the parameter. You would do this if you want to adjust the cutoff frequency very quickly. The parameter can only change as fast as the timeline rate, typically 1/60 seconds. Changed quickly, the stepping in frequency is noticeable. To improve on that, you would send a `cutofffrequency` channel in that is at a higher sample rate, like 400, which you can set in a CHOP like an LFO CHOP.

Extra Information for the Audio Filter CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

## Parameters - Movie Audio Page

Play `play` - Audio playback is enabled when this is set to On. No audio output when Off.
Movie File In TOP `moviefileintop` - Put the path of a Movie File In TOP in this parameter. The file named in the Movie File In TOP will be the source for the audio.
Pre-Read Length `prereadlength` - Use to read-ahead the audio into cache. You can specify in samples, frames and in seconds using the Units menu.
Pre-Read Length Unit `prereadlengthunit` - Specify which units to use for the Pre-Read Length parameter.
Open Timeout `opentimeout` - The amount of time TouchDesigner will wait for the audio samples to be read from the movie file. On file opening, if this timeout period is reached and the read-ahead has not finished, the audio will be output as zeros until all the pre-read samples have been read from the file.
Audio Sync Offset `syncoffset` - Offsets the audio playback of the movie. This can be used to get better sync between the audio and images in the movie when there is audio latency in the system (For example, audio latency from the [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP") queue). A negative value plays audio that amount of time sooner, to counteract delay introduced by buffering such as in [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP").
Audio Sync Offset Unit `syncoffsetunit` - Specify which units to use for the Audio Sync Offset parameter.
Index Channel `index` - Turn this parameter On to output an additional channel which reports the current position in the movie ie. 0 = start, 1 = end.
Audio Track Index `audiotrack` - When the movie has multiple audio tracks available this parameter can select between them.

Audio Oscillator CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Oscillator CHOP

The Audio Oscillator CHOP generates sounds in three ways. It repeats common waveforms (sine, triangle), it generates white noise (a random number for each sample), or it repeats a prepared incoming audio clip of any duration. It outputs typically 44100 samples per second. In contrast, the [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html "LFO CHOP") by default generates waves at lower frequencies and lower sample rates (60 samples/second), however both Audio Oscillator and LFO are interchangeable by changing their frequencies and sample rates.

When it is synthesizing tones from the basic waveforms, the Audio Oscillator CHOP steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Pitch Control input. By default, a Pitch Control of 0 gives a middle A at 440 Hz; a 1 gives 880 Hz; a -1 gives 220 Hz. Steps of 1 in Pitch Control are 1 octave apart. Steps of 1/12 (.08333) are 1 semitone apart.

The Audio Oscillator is roughly modelled after the [APR 2600 voltage-controlled oscillator](https://www.google.com/search?q=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design&oq=ARP+2600+Oscillator+design) (VCO).

Up to three input CHOPs can be connected to the Audio Oscillator CHOP.

**Pitch Control** - The first (optional) input affects the pitch. Output channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. When pitch control is 0, it outputs a wave at the base frequency (default 440 Hz at 44,100 samples per second). It is "logarithmic": By default, increasing the pitch control by 1 increases the pitch by 1 octave, by 2 it increases by 2 octaves (4 times the frequency).

**Reset Pulse** - The second (optional) input contains pulses that restart the oscillator from the beginning of the wave or the Playback Source. 0 in the input means "play the oscillator". 1 means "stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform or Playback Source".

**Playback Source** - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a sound clip to play at a rate modified by the Pitch Control, and can contain any number of channels. These channels are generated for each Pitch Control channel. The waveform Type and the Base Frequency parameters are disabled.

If you plug any sound clip into the Audio Oscillator CHOP's Playback Source, and Pitch Control is a constant value of 0 of any duration, it will just repeat the Playback Source. If you feed a [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP") as its Pitch Control, it will raise and lower the speed/pitch of the input.

The Audio Oscillator CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you put motion channels into the third input, you can control the time warp by feeding different Pitch Control curves. 0 pitch is normal speed, 1 is double speed.

Unlike the Wave CHOP, this is an iterating CHOP, that is, it steps through the waveform while the pitch changes. To see this effect, feed an LFO CHOP into the Audio Oscillator. Unlike the LFO CHOP, the Audio Oscillator CHOP is designed for audio frequencies.

## Parameters - Waveform Page

Type `wavetype` - ⊞ - The shape of the waveform to repeat, unless overridden by the Playback Source:

* Sine `sin` - (-1 to 1)

* Gaussian `normal` - (0 to 1)

* Triangle `tri` - (-1 to 1)

* Ramp `ramp` - (0 to 1)

* Square `square` - (-1 to 1)

* Pulse `pulse` - (0 to 1)

* White Noise `whitenoise` - Random samples between -1 and 1

Base Frequency `frequency` - The cycles per second when the Pitch Control is zero.
Units per Octave `octave` - Amount that the Pitch Control needs to increase by to raise the pitch by one octave. The default of 1 means that Pitch Control of 1 raises the pitch by 1 octave. Units per Octave of .08333 means that a Pitch Control of 3 raises the pitch by a factor of 3 x .08333 (three semitones). This is suitable for using MIDI note numbers as pitch control.
Offset `offset` - Values output from the CHOP can have an offset added to them.
Amplitude `amp` - Values output from the CHOP can be scaled.
Bias `bias` - Shape control for Triangle, Gaussian and Square waves. For triangle waves, it moves the peak. For square waves, it alters the width of the peak. Zero means no bias.
Phase `phase` - A value of .5 is a phase shift of 180 degrees, or one half cycle.
Smooth Pitch Changes `smooth` - If the Pitch Control channel input to the Audio Oscillator CHOP is rising and is running at the Touch default of 60 frames per second, then the pitch will hold for 1/60 second before stepping up for another 1/60 second. This is an audible step. With this option On, the pitch rises for every audio sample, giving perfectly smooth glissando at extra compute cost.
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).

* Off to On `offtoon` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on.

* While On `on` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off.

* On to Off `ontooff` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off.

* While Off `off` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.

Reset `reset` - This button resets the channel(s) to 0 when On.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.

## Parameters - Channel Page

Sample Rate `rate` - Set the sample rate of the CHOP in samples per second.

* Input 0:  -
* Input 1:  -
* Input 2:  -

Audio Para EQ CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Para EQ CHOP

The Audio Para EQ CHOP (parametric [equalizer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio))) applies up to 3 parametric filters to the incoming sound. The three filters are in series, where internally, the second filter takes its input from the output of the first filter, and so on.

It is called parametric because each filter has 3 controls - center frequency, bandwidth and boost, which in the old days, was more than usual analog filters.

Each filter has a center frequency (the Frequency parameter) where the filter will have the most effect, and a bandwidth which is roughly expressed in octaves, and is typically 3 or 4. The Boost parameter, when it is greater than 0, will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.

You can best hear the effects of the Audio Para EQ CHOP by passing it rich-spectrum music. The Audio Para EQ CHOP is implemented with three 4-pole filters internally.

Input 2-4: See [Frequency Modulation Channels](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html#Frequency_Modulation_Channels_Input "Audio Para EQ CHOP"), and the Scope parameter.

The Audio Para EQ CHOP is implemented as three 4-pole filters in series.

## Parameters - Parametric EQ Page

Frequency Units `units` - ⊞ - How frequency is expressed:

* Logarithmic `logarithmic` - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed as a power-of-10. See Frequency (Hz = 10\*\*val) below.

* Frequency `frequency` - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed in Hz.

Enable EQ1 `enableeq1` - When off, it passes the sound through the first equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ1 `boost1` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ1 `frequencylog1` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ1 `frequencyhz1` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ1 `bandwidth1` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Enable EQ2 `enableeq2` - When off, it passes the sound through the second equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ2 `boost2` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ2 `frequencylog2` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ2 `frequencyhz2` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ2 `bandwidth2` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Enable EQ3 `enableeq3` - When off, it passes the sound through the third equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ3 `boost3` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ3 `frequencylog3` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ3 `frequencyhz3` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ3 `bandwidth3` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Dry / Wet Mix `drywet` - As this parameter is reduced from 1 (Wet) toward 0 (Dry), it removes the effect of the filter.

## Frequency Modulation Channels Input

The second input is the **Frequency Modulation Channels**, which allows the filter parameters to be changed within the CHOP's time slice interval (typically 1/60 sec). This prevents audible stepping of the parameters that you are changing quickly.

You can send in a channel called `frequency` to override the value of the parameter. You would do this if you want to adjust the center frequency very quickly. The parameter can only change as fast as the timeline rate, typically 1/60 seconds. Changed quickly, the stepping in frequency is noticable. To improve on that, you would send a `frequency` channel in that is at a higher sample rate, like 400, which you can set in a CHOP like an LFO CHOP.

# Audio Play CHOP

The Audio Play CHOP plays back a sound file through any attached audio output device using DirectSound. It supports `.aif`, `.mp3`, `.mid`, `.wav` and `.m4a` files up to 48.000 kHz, which can have mono, stereo or even up to 5.1 channels in them. The audio channels can then be routed to any speaker location that DirectSound uses. See Outputs section below.

**NOTE**: With the Audio Play CHOP, audio samples do not enter or pass through TouchDesigner, so you will not see them in CHOPs, and you cannot process them in CHOPs. The Audio Play CHOP starts an external process that opens the file and sends it directly to the the audio outputs of your computer. If you want to process the audio within TouchDesigner or output them into a [Movie File Out TOP](Movie_File_Out_TOP.html "Movie File Out TOP") or [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP"), use the [Audio File In CHOP](Audio_File_In_CHOP.html "Audio File In CHOP").

The Audio Play CHOP contains a channel called *state*. This channel is 1 whenever any file is being played, 0 otherwise.

The first input (Input 0:Triggers) is used to trigger the audio file to play. The second input (Input 1: Volume) can be used to control volume, if no input is connected the Volume parameter will be used. The third input (Input 2: Pan) is for panning, no input assumes it is centered. When using the DAT List parameter, the inputs can contain mulitiple channels to manipulate each file individually. Multiple Audio Play CHOPs can output to different devices simutaneously.

It can also be triggered by the Trigger parameter below, but in this case if multiple files are specified via the DAT List, then all files will be played at the same time when triggered.

Sound files can also be triggered through the `play()` method [audioplayCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/AudioplayCHOP_Class "AudioplayCHOP Class"). Some advanced options are only available through the [audioplayCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/AudioplayCHOP_Class "AudioplayCHOP Class").

The file can be read in from disk or from the web. Use `http://` when specifying a URL.

* Play While On `on` - Plays while input is 1.

* Trigger `trigger` - Triggers once when input goes to 1.

* Loop `loop` - Plays and loops when input goes to 1.

Trigger `trigger` - Triggers the audio to play.
Cook Every Frame `cookalways` - Forces CHOP to cook every frame.

Stereo Mode `stereo` - Sets output to just 2 channels, front left and front right.

Outputs - The outputs on this page and the following Output 2 page are for routing to an audio device's different speaker outputs. Not all devices will support all outputs. For each speaker output, you can route any of the file's channels to play through it. For example, you can easily output the front left channel of the file to the all the front left speaker outputs, or you could output the front left channel to both front and rear speaker outputs. The value of each output parameter determines which channel from the file it plays, see below.

**File's channel mapping for outputs**

* -1 - no audio plays through this output
* 0 - File's front left channel will play
* 1 - File's front right channel will play
* 2 - File's rear left channel will play

Audio Render CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Render CHOP

**Note:** For M1 Macs, this operator only works starting with build 2022.33910.

The Audio Render CHOP uses the Steam Audio SDK to spatially render audio based on the full transforms (translation, rotation, scale) of a listener and an audio source. The Audio Render CHOP takes a mono sound audio source as input, and spatially outputs the sound in the format specified from the Output Format parameter. The number of channels outputted by the Audio Render CHOP depends on the Output Format.

You specify a 3D component for the transform of the listener, plus a 3D component for the transform of a source.

Look at the Audio Render CHOP example in Help -> Operator Snippets.

See also [Oculus Audio CHOP](Oculus_Audio_CHOP.html "Oculus Audio CHOP").

Audio Spectrum CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio Spectrum CHOP

The Audio Spectrum CHOP calculates and displays the frequency spectrum of the input channels.

In the default Visualization Mode the CHOP is set to display the spectrum in a more understandable way by emphasizing the higher frequency levels and the lower frequency ranges.

In another Mode, the Time to Magnitude and Phase mode, the audio can be converted to the frequency spectrum domain, manipulated and then converted back to get a filtered audio signal. When converting a signal to its spectrum, two channels are created from the one containing the audio signal. One channel contains the magnitude of the frequency components, and the other contains the phase. The channels are named, for example `chan1_m` and `chan1_p` where `_m` and `_p` are the suffixes for the magnitude and phase channels.

**Tip**: You can reduce cook time if you decrease the FFT Size from its default 8192 samples. The fastest form of this CHOP is by setting the Output Length parameter to "Output Length Manually". For example set the output buffer size to 2048 samples and the FFT Size to 2048. Each time it cooks, the CHOP is looking at the latest 2028 samples (at 44.1 KHz that amounts to the 50 msec, or 3 frames), which is plenty. Note the default form of the CHOP gives you 22,000 samples: 1 Hz to 22,050 Hz in steps of 1 Hz (when set to Frequency vs Logarithmic scaling), designed for clear interpretation: sample 1000 is the level of audio at 1000 Hz.

**Tip**: To find the exact frequency of a wave entering the Audio Spectrum CHOP, look at the Info pop-up for that node (MMB on the node). It says: Set "Frequency <-> Logarithmic Scaling" to 0, then multiply any sample to xxxx to get the Frequency at that sample. xxxx depends on the sample rates etc and isn't a constant.

See [Audio Filter CHOP](Audio_Filter_CHOP.html "Audio Filter CHOP"), [Audio Para EQ CHOP](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Para EQ CHOP"), [Audio Band EQ CHOP](Audio_Band_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Band EQ CHOP"), [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP") set to White Noise.

## Parameters - Spectrum Page

Mode `mode` - ⊞ - Select which mode to use, modes described below.

* Visualization `visual` - Show the spectrum in a way that more useful, with (by default) high frequencies boosted in level, and lower frequencies boosted in horizontal range.

* Time to Magnitude and Phase `timetoraw` - Calculate the frequency spectrum assuming input is a signal.

* Magnitude and Phase to Time `rawtotime` - Reconstructs a signal assuming input is a frequency spectrum similar to that coming from and Audio Spectum CHOP set to the above option.

FFT Size `fftsize` - ⊞ - Converting to frequency needs a power-of-2 number of samples, like 512, 1024, 2048. (FFT means Fast [Fourier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier) Transform.) The more samples, the more accurate the spectrum but the more it doesn't represent the most recent sound. Whatever the size, the CHOP uses the most recent samples. Knowing that audio at 44100 samples per second with a timeline frame rate of 60 frames per second gives 735 samples per frame, if the CHOP cooks 1 frame later and the FFT size is 1024, then it will re-use 1024-735 = 289 samples, which is good as there's a little overlap. However if it cooks 2 frames later, it will miss using 446 frames since it will have advanced 735\*2=1470 samples and it will only use 1024 of them.

* 64 `64` -

* 128 `128` -

* 256 `256` -

* 512 `512` -

* 1024 `1024` -

* 2048 `2048` -

* 4096 `4096` -

* 8192 `8192` -

* 16384 `16384` -

Frequency <-> Logarithmic Scaling `frequencylog` - Logarithmic (=1) is more tangible for human hearing. Each octave is represented with the same number of samples, so low frequencies are more readable. Frequency (=0) shows one sample for a fixed number of Hz, which is what the raw FFT gives, but most of the upper samples are uninteresting. Your ears hear ranges of octaves better. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: If Mode is set to Visualization and this parameter is set to 0, the output data is interpreted more simply: **1 sample per Hz**. Set the CHOP viewer Units to Samples (via RMB on CHOP graph) and the level you see at sample 5000 is the level at 5 KHz.
High Frequency Boost `highfreqboost` - When 0, the levels are not changed. When greater than 1, the levels are boosted, mostly at the high frequencies. High Frequency Boost can be over-driven past 1.
Output Length `outputmenu` - ⊞ - The method how output length will be determined.

* Match Length To Frequency `matchtofrequency` -

* Set Length Manually `setmanually` -

Set Output Length `outlength` - Number of Samples desired in output. The fewer the samples, the less the frequency resolution.

## Notes

A reasonable scenario (in terms of CPU usage) is an FFT size of 2048. You get good definition with the spectrum, and also enough padding to (almost) deal with two dropped frames.

An [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") can be attached and the channel `hz_per_sample` can be viewed. Applicable only of the Frequency axis is set to Linear.
With it set to output to normal FFT, to determine the frequency that a given sample represents, use the formula:

In order to convert back to a signal, both channels are required. The suffixes should be the same as those used in the previous Audio Spectrum CHOP.

Audio VST CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Audio VST CHOP

The Audio VST CHOP loads VST3 Plugin files that generate (instruments) or process (filter) audio. See the [VST](VST.html "VST") overview.

The plugin's parameters can be exposed and driven bi-directionally via a corresponding TouchDesigner parameter or the plugin's GUI control. In order to get the full benefit of the bidirectional nature of the plugin parameters it is recommended to use [Binding](Binding.html "Binding") or a [Bind CHOP](Bind_CHOP.html "Bind CHOP") when driving the parameter in TouchDesigner, rather than an expression or CHOP reference.

Python calls let you [send MIDI messages](AudiovstCHOP_Class.html "AudiovstCHOP Class") to the plugin. And if the plugin generates MIDI, you can get and process the messages in the [docked](Docking.html "Docking") callbacks DAT.

Depending on the plugin, the Audio VST CHOP takes up to 4 multi-channel inputs.

See the discussion on which VST plugins work well with TouchDesigner - [VST Plugin Testing](https://derivative.ca/community-post/vst-plugin-testing/65712). Also for a selection of free VSTs along with a useful set of affordable upgraded versions go here: [https://hy-plugins.com](https://hy-plugins.com/).

2 Free HY-Plugins are included with TouchDesigner and can be found using the Help > Browse Samples menu. This will open a file browser to the TouchDesigner application Samples folder which contains a VST3 folder holding one synthesizer and filter plugin for both Windows and MacOS. The Windows VST3 plugin files can be distinguished by their included "64 Bit" string.

Installed VST plugins are found in `C:Program Files/Common Files/VST` on Windows, and be `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` on macOS.

**Tip**: You can get detailed info about the VST plugin by attaching an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") to the CHOP.

[VST](VST.html "VST") is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH, registered in Europe and other countries.

## Parameters - VST Page

File `file` - The path to the VST3 plugin. Default install location for VST3 plugins is `C:/Program Files/Common Files/VST3` on Windows and `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3` on macOS.
Reload `reloadpulse` - Reloads the VST3 plugin.
Load Plugin State on Start `loadpluginstate` - The plugin state (including preset value and other UI elements) is saved into the toe file and is restored on TouchDesigner start, if enabled. The toggle exists to provide a work-around to plugins that do not behave well (eg. crash) when their plugin state is set; the toggle should be disabled in those cases.
Sample Rate `rate` - Sets the sample rate of the VST3 plugin.
Plugin GUI Always on Top `alwaysontop` - When enabled, the plugin window will always be on top of other windows.
Display Plugin GUI `displaygui` - When pulsed, will open the plugin GUI in a separate window. Changing a parameter in the plugin GUI while the learn toggle is enabled will create the parameter on the Audio VST CHOP side.
Learn Parameters `learnparms` - When enabled, parameters that are interacted with in the VST Plugin window will be created as parameters on the Plugin page, ie. they will be learned.
Regular Parameters `regularparms` - When enabled, every Plugin parameter will be created on the Plugin page.
Read-Only Parameters `readonlyparms` - When enabled, all read-only Plugin parameters will be created on the Plugin page. If Regular Parameters is also toggled on then this toggle will have no effect.
Clear Learned Parameters `clearlearnedparms` - When pulsed, all learned parameters will be cleared. If neither Regular or Read-only parameters are toggled on then the parameters will be destroyed.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Reference to the DAT containing Audio VST CHOP supported callbacks.

## Parameters - Bus Layout Page

Custom Bus Layout `custombuslayout` - Enables custom bus layout. If disabled the bus layout will be the plugin's default.
Output Bus Layout `outputbuslayout` - Select the output bus layout (ie. number of channels) of the output bus. This will directly affect how many channels the Audio VST CHOP has.
Main Input Bus Layout `maininputlayout` - Select the main input bus layout (ie. number of channels). The main input bus is always the CHOP's first input, and this selection determines how many channels it accepts from it.
Aux Input `aux` - This sequence describes the aux inputs to the VST plugin
Enable `aux0enable` - Enable the auxiliary bus.
Bus Layout `aux0layout` - Select the auxiliary bus layout (ie. number of channels) for the auxiliary input. An auxiliary input is every input after the main input. Not every plugin will support auxiliary buses, and the parameter will be disabled if not supported. If no more sequential auxiliary buses can be added (ie. the +/- disappears in the parameter sequence) then that means the auxiliary bus maximum has been reached.

## Parameters - Playhead Page

Custom Playhead `customplayhead` - Enable the custom playhead. When disabled, the plugin will always sequentially step forward in time. Not all plugins support a custom playhead.
Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - Specifies the playhead time of the plugin. A reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") object.
Tempo (bpm) `tempo` - The tempo of the playhead. Not all plugins support changing of the tempo via the playhead.
Signature `signature` - ⊞ - The time signature of the playhead. Not all plugins support changing of the time signature via the playhead.

Basis SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Basis SOP

The Basis SOP provides a set of operations applicable to the parametric space of spline curves and surfaces. The parametric space, also known as the "domain" of a NURBS or Bzier primitive, is defined by one basis in the U direction and, if the primitive is a surface, another basis in the V direction. The size of the domain is given by the values of the knots that make up the basis.

[![BasisSOP.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/b/b8/BasisSOP.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:BasisSOP.gif)

The Basis SOP contains both ratio-preserving and non ratio-preserving operations.

If the basis reparameterization does not change the distance ratios between knots, the shape of a NURBS primitive is not affected. If the ratios are not preserved, however, a NURBS primitive will change shape in the area influenced by the modified knots; furthermore, if the primitive is a NURBS or Bzier surface, any profiles it may contain will be affected as well.

For more information about bases and knots see Breakpoints, Knots, and Spline Basis in the [Primitive](Primitive.html "Primitive") and [Spline](Spline.html "Spline") articles.

  + [6.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Basis Page

Group `group` - Group of spline primitives (accepts patterns, as described in: Scripting Guide). Non-spline types are ignored.

Two sets of pages follow, one for each parametric direction (U and V). In each set the operations are applied in tab order, starting from the left: Parameterization, Mapping, and then raising the spline Order. To disable all the operations of a set, toggle off the U or V check mark above it. The V set is meaningful only for spline surfaces, and is ignored otherwise. Channel names are given for both the U and V pages.

## Parameters - U Page

Edit the U Basis `ubasis` - Enable editing of the U Basis.
Parameterization `uparmtype` - ⊞ - Select the method of parameterization in u from the options below.

* Unchanged `nochange` - Does not change the basis.

* Uniform `uniform` - Distributes all the knots evenly, maintaining the basis origin and length. Recommended only for regular shapes.

* Chord Length `chord` - Computes the knot ratios based on the distances between successive CVs. This is the most common and most effective parameterization method.

* Centripetal `centripetal` - Similar to the chord length method. Recommended for shapes containing sharp turns.

* Manual: Single `manualone` - Loads the basis with the knots listed in the "Knot Sequence" below. If the SOP input contains several primitives, only the basis of the first spline primitive will be affected.

* Manual: Propagated `manualall` - Same as above + it copies the basis to the basis of all the other spline primitives in the model or in the group. Using this feature on curves that have the point count and degree will generate cleaner surfaces, i.e. surfaces with fewer isoparms.

* Knotslide `slide` - Shift clusters of knots within the basis. See Knotslide (From Paramaterization Menu) for discussion.

Knot Sequence `uknots` - The basis of the first spline primitive in the input loads its knot sequence with the data specified in this field when the Parameterization is set to Manual. The values must be in ascending order, and their total count must match the number of knots in the basis. To ensure an exact count, click on the Read Basis button to read the original knot sequence into this field.

**Note:** Bezier bases cannot have repeated knots. NURBS bases accept repeated knots as long as the knot multiplicity does not exceed the degree of the basis. The first two and last two knots of a NURBS basis must be identical.

Read Basis `uread` - Loads the original knots of the basis into the Knot Sequence field when the Parameterization type is Manual.
Range `urange` - ⊞ - Range specifies the domain interval to be shifted. All the knots captured in this range are shifted by the same amount as far as the closest neighbouring knot on either side.

* `urange1` -

* `urange2` -

Bias `ubias` - Bias indicates the direction and the amount of translation. A Bias of 0.5 does not displace the knots at all. As the Bias decreases, the knot cluster migrates closer to its left-neighbouring knot. A Bias greater than 0.5 forces a migration to the right.

Sometimes a Bias of 0 or 1 does not clamp the knot cluster to the closest neighbouring knot. The reason for this behaviour is that the knot multiplicity cannot be allowed to exceed the degree of the basis. For example, an order 4 (degree 3, or "cubic") spline can have at most 3 identical knots in sequence.
When sliding the knot of a NURBS basis, a larger area of that spline is affected. This may create the impression than more knots than those in the cluster are being displaced.

Concatenate `uconcat` - Indicates whether the bases of the input spline primitives should be concatenated such that the last knot of the first primitive coincides with the first knot of the second primitive, and so on. This operation is performed before the ones below it, thus allowing a whole set of bases to be mapped onto a given interval (usually [0,1]) while enforcing basis continuity.
Origin `udoorigin` - Enables the Origin parameter.
Origin `uorigin` - The new origin of the basis, or the origin of the cummulated bases if Concatenation is On.
Length `udolength` - Enables the Length parameter.
Length `ulength` - The new length of the basis, or the total length of the cummulated bases if Concatenation is On. The Length, which represents the distance between the first and last knot, must be greater than zero.
Scale `udoscale` - Enables the Scale parameter.
Scale `uscale` - The multiplier applied to the basis starting at the basis origin. The Scale must be greater than zero.
Raise to `uraise` - Enables the Raise to parameter.
Raise U to `orderu` - The only operation here is raising the order (or degree) of the spline basis. Valid orders range from 2 to 11. Orders lower than the current spline order are ignored. The operation preserves the shape of the primitive.

**Production Tip:** Before applying a spline-based texture projection with the Texture SOP, remap the U and/or V bases of the spline surface between 0 and 1 to ensure a complete mapping of the texture. If a single texture map must be shared by several surfaces, the surface bases should be concatenated prior to being remapped.

## Parameters - V Page

Edit the V Basis `vbasis` - Enable editing of the V Basis.
Parameterization `vparmtype` - ⊞ - Select the method of parameterization in v from the options below.

* Unchanged `nochange` -

* Uniform `uniform` -

* Chord Length `chord` -

* Centripetal `centripetal` -

* Manual: Single `manualone` -

* Manual: Propagated `manualall` -

* Knotslide `slide` -

* `vrange1` -

* `vrange2` -

Extra Information for the Basis SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Beat CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Beat CHOP

The Beat CHOP generates a variety of ramps, pulses and counters that are timed to the beats per minute and the sync as produced by the [Beat Dialog](Beat_Dialog.html "Beat Dialog").

* You can generate a ramp every 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 32 beats.
* You can generate ramps of any other length, like 12 beats per bar (ramp) and fractional beats like 3.33 beats per ramp.
* You can generate a set of channels, where each channel is delayed relative to the prior channel. This is useful, for example, for moving eight objects delayed by one beat each.
* There also is a counter of how many ramps it has generated.
* The Count+Ramp type generates a continuously-rising ramp equal to the number of cycles since the start.
* If Play Mode is set to Local Sequential, it doesn't look at start/end of the timeline (i.e. doesn't reset when the timeline loops), so is more appropriate for long improvised playing.

**Note:** for the purposes of this dialog, a *bar* is 4 beats and the *period* is the number of beats set by the Period parameter.

The [Beat Dialog](Beat_Dialog.html "Beat Dialog") is used to manually tap the beat to set the beats-per-minute (BPM). The Beat CHOP converts the BPM into a repeating ramp or pulse that keeps time with the music after you stop tapping.

You can set the global beats-per-minute with the python command: `op('/local/time').tempo = 140`

The phase can be controlled with the Beat CHOP's Reset parameters.

The Beat CHOP's timing is defined by the [Component Time](Component_Time.html "Component Time") of the Reference Node. If the Reference Node parameter is left blank, then the time defined at the Beat CHOP's location is used. The default is in `/local/time`.

See also: [Timeline CHOP](Timeline_CHOP.html "Timeline CHOP"), [Time COMP](Time_COMP.html "Time COMP").

## Parameters - Beat Page

Reference Operator `op` - This node is used to specify the time settings referenced by the Beat CHOP. The time is defined by the Time COMP found at `timepath("reference_node")`
Use Reference Time Slice `reftimeslice` - Turn on this checkbox to use the [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") used by the Reference Node.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Specifies the method used to playback the output.

* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the output to the local component [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline"). Scrubbing or jumping in the local time will update the output accordingly. When the local timeline loops the output is reset and starts over. The output will be the same for each pass through the local timeline.

* Locked to Global `global` - This mode locks the output to the Global beat source. It will follow the Beat CHOP with whose 'Update Global' flag is turned on.

* Local Sequential `local` - This mode produces a continuous output regardless of the timeline position.

Period `period` - Number of beats it takes to generate one cycle of ramp. Use the drop down menu to select from some commonly used Period lengths.
Multiples `multiples` - The number of channels to create.
Shift Offset `shiftoffset` - Delays all channels by this amount. 0 = no change, .5 means 50% of one period later.
Shift Step `shiftstep` - When set to 1, and Multiples is 5, each ramp channel is 1/5 cycle later than the previous channel. When set to .1, the delay is 1/50 cycle. This is a way to stagger the channels.
Random Offset `randoffset` - The amount that each ramp is randomly time-shifted relative to a perfect ramp.
Random Seed `randseed` - Changing this generates a different set of random offsets.
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).

Reset Bar Value `resetbarvalue` - Specifies which Bar the Beat CHOP will jump to when the Reset Condition is met. Beat values are derived from the fractional part of this value.
Wait after Reset `resetwait` - When using the **While On** Reset Condition, Wait After Reset will hold the channels at zero until the next bar is started, after which the output will continue. When Wait After Reset is off, the channels will restart output as soon as the reset condition is done.
Reset `reset` - This button resets the ramps to zero when On. The ramp is also zero when the Beat CHOP's input is above 0.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets the ramps to zero.
Update Global `updateglobal` - Any Beat CHOP can be made the "global beat source" by turning on Update Global. A reference Beat CHOP is created at /local/master\_beat (if it doesn't already exist) and all Beat CHOPs can synchronize to this by setting 'Play Mode: Locked to Global'. That master Beat CHOP also needs 'Update Global' turned on, if not already on. This means you require exactly one master Beat CHOP per toe. You can turn switch back to 'Play Mode: Locked to Sequential' when desired. $MASTER\_BEAT is set to whatever Beat CHOP has this option turned on.

Ramp `ramp` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each period.
Pulse `pulse` - Outputs a pulse each period.
Sine `sine` - Outputs a sine wave each period.
Count `count` - Increases the count each period.
Count+Ramp `countramp` - A ramp that counts up until the bar is reset.
Bar `bar` - Output the current bar.
Beat `beat` - Output the current beat.
Sixteenths `sixteenths` - Output the current sixteenths.
Ramp Bar `rampbar` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.
Ramp Beat `rampbeat` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each beat.
BPM `bpm` - Outputs the current BPM.

Extra Information for the Beat CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Bezier Class - Derivative

# Bezier Class

A Bezier describes an instance of a single geometry Bezier primitive (containing a set of connected Bezier curves). It is an instance of a [Prim Class](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class").
It can be created from either a [Model SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/ModelSOP_Class "ModelSOP Class") or [Script SOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/ScriptSOP_Class "ScriptSOP Class").
Each curve is described by a set of segments, where each segment is a list of [vertices](Vertex_Class.html "Vertex Class"). The first and last vertex of each segment is an anchor position, while its neighboring vertices describe tangent handles.

The members and methods below allow modification of the Bezier in a modelling context, however the Bezier can also be modified by direction manipulation of its vertices. See [Prim Class](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") for more details.

`anchors` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns the list of anchor [vertices](Vertex_Class.html "Vertex Class").

`basis` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Return the bezier basis as a list of float values.

`closed` → `bool` :

> Get or set whether the curve is closed or open.

`order` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Return the bezier order. The order is one more than the degree.

`segments` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns a list of segments, where each segment is a list of [vertices](Vertex_Class.html "Vertex Class").

`tangents` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns the tangents as a list of [vertex](Vertex_Class.html "Vertex Class") pairs.

`insertAnchor(u)`→ `Vertex`:

> inserts anchor at given position (u from 0..1) and returns anchor vertex.

`updateAnchor(anchorIndex, targetPosition, tangents=True)`→ `tdu.Position`:

> Modify the anchor vertex to the new [position](Position_Class.html "Position Class"). If tangents is True, modify neighboring tangent vertices as well. Returns resulting position.

`appendAnchor(targetPosition, preserveShape=True)`→ `Vertex`:

> Appends a set of vertices, creating a new segment on the curve, ending with the targetPosition.
> 
> Returns final anchor vertex.
> 
> * preserveShape - (Keyword, Optional) Specifies whether the new tangent will align with the previous segment or not.

`updateTangent(tangentIndex, targetPosition, rotate=True, scale=True, rotateLock=True, scaleLock=True)`→ `tdu.Position`:

> Modify the vertex vertex to the new [position](Position_Class.html "Position Class"), constraining either rotation or scale. Locked controls matching tangent. Returns resulting position.

`deleteAnchor(anchorIndex)`→ `None`:

> Deletes the anchor and its neighbouring tangents.

Bind CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bind CHOP

Allows for [binding](Binding.html "Binding") of CHOP channels and parameters.

When a parameter is bound to a channel in the Bind CHOP (via the [parameter modes](Parameter_Mode.html "Parameter Mode") Export or Bind), any change in the channel will update the parameter value, and vice versa any change to the parameter will update the channel value.

Additionally, the Bind CHOP is a multi-input CHOP and will match input channels by Channel Number or Channel Name. It monitors the matched channels and updates the Bind CHOP's output channel to match whichever input changed most recently. When bound to a parameter (via Export mode or Bind mode) changes to any matched input or the bound parameter will update the channel's value.

A 'Callbacks DAT' is available for querying where the change was initiated and then taking further actions via python script.

This workflow is useful for binding multiple inputs to a parameter. For example, one input channel might be coming from a [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") input device, and another channel coming from an [OSC](OSC.html "OSC") input device, and you want them both to control a given parameter. The Bind CHOP's output channel which is bound to the parameter will update to stay in sync with the most recent change from either of the inputs or the parameter. See video demonstration below.

BlackTrax CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# BlackTrax CHOP

**NOTE**

**License:** Only available in [TouchDesigner Pro](TouchDesigner_Pro.html "TouchDesigner Pro").

The BlackTrax CHOP will provide motion tracking data from [BlackTrax Motion Tracking Systems](http://blacktrax.cast-soft.com/) is a vision-based real-time tracking system developed by [CAST Software](http://cast-soft.com/) that specializes in large-scale performances. BlackTrax Beacons ("BTBeacons") are attached to performers or rigid objects, and the BlackTrax system accurately tracks the Beacon's position, rotation, velocity, and acceleration.

The BlackTrax CHOP will accept tracking data from [BlackTrax Motion Tracking Systems](http://blacktrax.cast-soft.com/). See [BlackTrax](BlackTrax.html "BlackTrax").

The BlackTrax CHOP works in conjunction with the BlackTrax system. BlackTrax tracks up to 85 BlackTrax Beacons and sends
data regarding their position, rotation, velocity, and acceleration to TouchDesigner inside [RTTrPM Packets](https://rttrp.github.io/RTTrP-Wiki/RTTrPM.html). Each Beacon can have up to 3 LEDs attached, which can also be independently tracked in TouchDesigner. Each Beacon will have an ID that is specified in BlackTrax software and that Beacon ID must be mapped correctly to CHOP channels in TouchDesigner using the Mapping Table. Alternatively if the IDs are incremental then the "From Max Beacons" option in "Output Format" can be used.

### Server Settings

The server software should be set to send data in the WYSIWYG coordinate system (which should be the default). Rotations should be sent in Euler angles, not Quaternions. TouchDesigner should support both endian settings, but it's best to leave those as their default values.

## Parameters - BlackTrax Page

Active `active` - While on, the CHOP receives information sent to the network port. While Off, no updating occurs.
Port `port` - The port that will accept packets.
Protocol `protocol` - ⊞ - The network protocol to use. Refer to the [Network Protocols](Network_Protocols.html "Network Protocols") article for more information.

* Messaging (UDP) `msging` -

* Multi-Cast Messaging (UDP) `multicastmsging` -

Sample Rate `samplerate` - Sets the sample rate of this CHOP.
Output Format `outputformat` - ⊞ - Specifies the format for the CHOP channels (ie. how many beacons to add). "From Mapping Table" adds one beacon to the CHOP for every row in the mapping table. "From Max Beacons" adds the number specified in the "Max Beacons" parameter.

* From Mapping Table `fromtable` -

* From Max Beacons `frombeacons` -

Max Beacons `maxbeacons` - Specifies how many beacons to add to the CHOP. Used with the "From Max Beacons" output format.
Centroid `centroid` - When enabled, adds beacon translation and rotation channels.
Velocity `velocity` - When enabled, adds beacon velocity channels.
Acceleration `acceleration` - When enabled, adds beacon acceleration channels.
LEDs `leds` - When enabled, adds position channels for each LED in the beacon.
Reset Channels `reset` - Clears any stored beacons and removes any stale data while On.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly clears any stored beacons and removes any stale data.
Mapping Table `mappingtable` - A DAT table that maps beacon IDs to CHOP channels (beacon0, beacon1, etc.). The first row will map to beacon0, second row to beacon1, etc. Beacon ID is a unique non-negative integer and is specified within BlackTrax applications.

Below is an example of a mapping table that is tracking 3 beacons with IDs 10, 11, and 12. In this example 10 is mapped to beacon0, 11 is mapped to beacon1, and 12 is mapped to beacon2.

# Blend CHOP

The Blend CHOP combines two or more CHOPs in input 2, 3 and so on, by using a set of blending channels in input 1. The blending channels cause different strengths of the CHOPs to contribute to the output of the CHOP. It works like the [Blend SOP](Blend_SOP.html "Blend SOP").

The first channel of input 2 is blended with the first channel of input 3 and input 4 and so on.

Input 1 acts as the control input, which contains the blend weight channels for the rest of the inputs. In it there is one channel for each of the blended CHOPs coming in on input 2, 3 and so on.

The first channel in input 1 is input 2's blend weight, the second channel in input 1 is the input 3's blend weight, and so on. There should be as many blend channels in input 1 as there are inputs, excluding input 1. (However when using Differencing and Omit First Weight Channel is on, the first channel if inout 1 ias assumed to be the weight of input 3, as input 2 is the "base" and doesn't need a weight.)

The interval of the output of the CHOP is the interval of input 1 (the blend channels).

If input 2 onwards are just poses, it's acceptable, as the CHOP blends between poses by using extend conditions.

**Note:** This CHOP is optimized and doesn't cook inputs that have zero weight.

## Parameters - Blend Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - The blend method:

* Proportional `prop` - Each blend source contributes to the result according to its blend weight. If the blend weights do not add up to one, they are scaled so that they do.

* Difference `dif` - In this default behavior of the Blend CHOP, the input 2 is always the "base". There are blend channels for all the other inputs, and when they are all zero, you get base. If any one blend channel is 1 and the others are zero, then your output is the same as the input that corresponds to that blend channel.

* Quaternion (Commercial) `quaternion` - The first input is used to control the proportional blending of the second two inputs using quaternions. Blending rotation channels properly involves grouping the channels into quaternion groups with the Attribute CHOP before using this or similar quaternion options.

* Additive `additive` - This method works the same as proportional except the blend weights are not normalized.

Omit First Weight Channel `firstweight` - When using the Differencing method, the weight channel for the base input has no effect, so the channel is omitted if this option is On.
Fix Underflows `underflow` - Replace denormalized (very small) numerical values with 0. These values can otherwise cause performance issues.

Blend COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Blend COMP

The Blend Component allows the blending of its attached 3D objects, allowing you to animate the parents of Components, sequencing (object A to object B to C, etc.), partial transformation inheritance, three-point orientation, and other effects. It gives you some extra flexibility in setting up parent-child relationships. It operates like the Switch and Sequence Blend SOPs insofar as it takes more than one input and blends or switches those into one output. It affects the object transform only, not the contents of the blended components.

Some potential uses of the Blend op are to animate parenting, such as when one character passes an item to another, or to pass on only part of a parents characteristics.

Note that the effect of the Blend COMP is only visible through a [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") or the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") that is rendering that camera's view.

See also [Camera Blend COMP](Camera_Blend_COMP.html "Camera Blend COMP").

Type `parenttype` - ⊞ - Method in which parent transforms (i.e. Translate, Rotate, Scale) are combined to produce a unique blended transform.

* Blend `blend` - When the type is set to *Blend* up to the first 4 inputs will be blended using the Weight[1-4] and Mask[1-4] parameters.

* Sequence `sequence` - When the type is set to *Sequence* this value controls which input parent contributes to the child's position. It can be used to animate a child from one parent to another. A sequence value outside the range of inputs is interpreted as unparenting the child.

* Constrain `constrain` - This object is constrained to the specified input parent. As the parent changes, the relative transform is maintained. This transform is reset when the reset frame is reached. Changing the constraint parent maintains the position without jumping.

Sequence `sequence` - Enabled when Type parameter above is set to Sequence or Constrain, it selects which input's transform to use.
Reset Frame `reset` - When in constrain mode, this will reset the final transform back to its original position. On other frames, when the constrained parent changes, the relative transform to this Object is maintained.
Weight 1 `blendw1` - These weights are used to weight each corresponding input parent.
Mask 1 `blendm1` - These masks are used to select which component of each parent is used in the blending process.
Weight 2 `blendw2` - These weights are used to weight each corresponding input parent.
Mask 2 `blendm2` - These masks are used to select which component of each parent is used in the blending process.
Weight 3 `blendw3` - These weights are used to weight each corresponding input parent.
Mask 3 `blendm3` - These masks are used to select which component of each parent is used in the blending process.
Weight 4 `blendw4` - These weights are used to weight each corresponding input parent.
Mask 4 `blendm4` - These masks are used to select which component of each parent is used in the blending process.
Normal Offset `noffset` - When exactly three parents are input, the child position may be offset in the direction perpendicular to the triangular plane they form.
Orient Axes `axesorient` - When exactly three parents are input this option will orient the child's local axes to match the orientation of the parents as follows:

* **First Parent**: Axes Center
* **Second Parent**: Axes +X
* **Third Parent**: Axes +Y

Short Rotation `shortrot` - Does quaternion blending in cases with 2 inputs are being blended.

# Blend SOP

The Blend SOP provides 3D metamorphosis between shapes with the same topology. It can blend between sixteen input SOPs using the average weight of each input's respective channel. It will also interpolate point colors and/or texture co-ordinates between shapes.

For best results, there should be the same number of points / CVs (and faces) in the geometry of each SOP. The points should have a similar order; if point 17 in one source is on the left side, and point 17 in another Source is on the right side, it will move across the object during the blend, which may create distorted and twisted shapes. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you can make all the pieces to be blended by editing point positions of one common base shape. Each of the pieces to be morphed must be in different SOPs.

For example, when editing the shapes in the Model Editor, each particular geometry can be saved and then read in, or input the Model SOP directly into the Blend SOP. You would then have the base model geometry entering the Blend SOP in the first Blend, then up to 15 Model SOPs feeding from the SOP containing the base model geometry, which in turn would feed into the Blend SOP. Remember that Model SOPs cannot be unlocked and, therefore, are a safe way to store data without using a File In SOP.

The Blend SOP now only cooks non-zero-weighted inputs.

See also [Sequence Blend SOP](Sequence_Blend_SOP.html "Sequence Blend SOP").

Group `group` - Specifies a point or primitive group in the first input. If, for example, a group is specified containing the first and third points, then the first and third point of every input will be blended whereas the second, fourth, fifth, etc. points will be set to match the first input source. Accepts patterns, as described in: [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Differencing `diff` - Generates exaggerated blends between objects where values above 1 or less than 0 will result in over-scaled blends.

When this option is checked, the above channel values are not summed and scaled to 1. The first input is considered a reference; Blend computes the difference between the first input and the others for each point; values greater than 1 and less than 0 produce exaggerations of the shapes for inputs 2 and higher. The first input, however, cannot be exaggerated by its blend channel, /blend1, and it is considered to be the "base". When using Differencing, the /blend1 channel has no effect. If the geometry in the first input must be deformed, feed it into another input, where the blend channels have an effect.

Blend Position `dopos` - When checked, the point positions of the inputs will be blended based on the weights of the blend channels. If not checked, the input geometry will not change, only allowing Blending of Colors, Normals and Textures if selected.
Blend Colors `doclr` - When checked, the point colors of the geometry inputs will be blended based on the weights of the blend channels.
Blend Normals `donml` - When checked, the point normals of the geometry inputs will be blended based on the weights of the blend channels.
Blend Texture `douvw` - When checked, the point texture co-ordinates of the geometry inputs will be blended based on the weights of the blend channels.
Blend Up `doup` - When checked, the Up Vector of the geometry inputs will be blended based on the weights of the blend channels.

## Parameters - Weights Page

Channels controlling the contribution of the geometry inputs to the output geometry. Add parameters below as needed for the number of inputs connected.

Input `input` - Sequence of input weights
Weight `input0weight` - The weight or contribution of this input. 0 has no contribution, 1 is full contribution.

This SOP can be used as a form of geometry deformation. Model your geometry, such as the mouth on the head of a character. This will become your first input.

## Example

Set the input to the first SOP to be blended. For example, if there are five shapes to be blended, the simplest set-up is the following:

Use four Model SOPs, and import the geometry from the base geometry to be deformed / morphed. In each of the Model SOPs, edit the geometry to suit.

Append a Blend SOP off of the SOP containing the base geometry and then proceed to connect up the four Model SOPs into the Blend SOP.

The amount that each input contributes to the resulting shape is controlled by each input's blend channel. Editing the values of the blend channels will result in each input to determine the final shape based on ratios.

For example, if the /blend3 channel's value is 1, and the rest of the channels are set to 0, the resulting shape is the geometry in the third input SOP. Now change the value in the /blend5 channel to 1, the resulting shape will be a 50/50 percent blend of the geometry contained in the input SOPs' three and five. You would get the exact same result by setting both channels to 0.3, or to any number if the numbers are the same in both channels, there will be equal contribution to the shape.

Blob Track CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Blob Track CHOP

The Blob Track CHOP allows tracking blobs in 2D point data.

Input data should be have two channels named *tx* and *ty* describing the 2D points in cartesian coordinates. See the [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") examples.

Good sources for input scans are the [Hokuyo CHOP](Hokuyo_CHOP.html "Hokuyo CHOP") (in Cartesian coordinate mode) and the [Leuze ROD4 CHOP](Leuze_ROD4_CHOP.html "Leuze ROD4 CHOP"). These devices naturally output a radial scan from the device as the center point, where each point represents (angle, distance). Outputting each scan point in Cartesian coordinate mode gives an (x,y) for each point which is the format required for the Blob Track CHOP.

But any set of (x,y) points in the two channels will be analyzed. The tracker looks for consecutive points close to each other, and handles the case where one blob passes behind another blob giving the hidden blob a linear motion for a specifiable amount of time while it occluded before it removes the blob from the set of blobs being output.

## Parameters - Tracker Page

Active `active` - While on, the CHOP receives information from the input. While off, no processing occurs. Existing blobs will remain.
Search Mode `searchmode` - ⊞ - Controls how searching for blobs is done across all the points.

* All `all` - All the points are compared against each other to find blobs. This mode is slower but more robust for data that has the points randomly assorted in the CHOP.

* Consecutive Points `consecutive` - Points are only compared against points in neighbouring samples of the CHOP data to find blobs. This is much faster but the data much be setup such that points that are close to each other in space are next to each other in the CHOP samples. Data coming from devices such as the [Hokuyo CHOP](Hokuyo_CHOP.html "Hokuyo CHOP") and [Leuze ROD4 CHOP](Leuze_ROD4_CHOP.html "Leuze ROD4 CHOP") output data in this format.

Max Blobs `maxblobs` - The maximum number of blobs that can be tracked.
Max Point Distance in Blob `maxpointdistance` - Two measured points from the input are considered to be part of the same blob if they are this distance or closer to each other.
Max Blob Movement `maxblobmovement` - This controls the maximum distance a blob can move between successive frames and still be considered the same 'blob'.
Area of Interest `areaofinterest` - ⊞ - Limits the area in which blobs are tracked. Points outside the area of interest are ignored.

* Off `off` - No limitations, blobs tracked throughout the scanned area.

* Rectangle `rectangle` - Blobs only tracked within specified rectangle.

* Circle `circle` - Blobs only tracked within specified circle (or ellipse).

Center `center` - ⊞ - The center of the area of interest.

* Center `centerx` -

* Center `centery` -

Size `size` - ⊞ - The size of the area of interest.

* Size `sizew` -

* Size `sizeh` -

Rotate `rotate` - Rotate the area of interest.
Allow Movement Outside Area `allowmovementoutside` - When this is on, blobs detected within the Area of Interest can move outside of that area and still be tracked. When this is off blobs that move outside the area of interest will stop being tracked.

## Parameters - Blobs Page

Output Centroid `outputcentroid` - Include the centroid of detected blobs as part of the output channels.
Output Velocity `outputvelocity` - Include the velocity of detected blobs as part of the output channels.
Min Points per Blob `minblobpoints` - Minimum number of points that must be near each other to form a blob. Use to help filter out false positives.
Blob Init Time (s) `blobinittime` - Amount of time a blob must be detected to be considered trustworthy. Use to help filter out false positives. A blob will only be output if it's been detected for at least time amount of time.
Lost Blob Timeout (s) `lostblobtimeout` - The amount of time before a blob that has been lost is removed from the output.
Blob Movement Prediction Type `predicttype` - ⊞ - With prediction enabled, blobs from the last frame have their new position predicted before being matched to the current frame.

* Off `off` - Blobs are matched against the blob positions from the last frame.

* Simple Forward Predict `simple` - Prediction uses constant velocity assumption; blobs are moved the same distance that they moved last frame.

* Kalman Filter Predict `kalman` - Prediction uses [kalman filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter), with a constant velocity model, to move the blobs forward from last frame.

Blob Track TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Blob Track TOP

The Blob Track TOP is implemented using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org//).

To get the results of the Blob Track TOP, attach an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") or [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") to it. The Info reports the current blob IDs, coordinates and sizes in pixels. The blob ID increases for every new blob that is detected.

It converts the incoming image to monochrome (since it operates on an single color channel), but to better prepare the image, preceed it with a Monochrome TOP followed by a Luma Level TOP, and adjust Black Level, Brightness and Gamma.

Typical usage is connecting a video source (such as [Video Device In TOP](Video_Device_In_TOP.html "Video Device In TOP") to the Blob Track TOP).

**NOTE:** can track an unlimited number of blobs in Pro and Commercial, and up to 2 blobs in the Non-Commercial version of TouchDesigner.

There are two workflows with the Blob Track TOP.

### SimpleBlobDetector

[SimpleBlobDetector](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d0/d7a/classcv_1_1SimpleBlobDetector.html) is a blob detection algorithm in OpenCV. This method will automatically be used if **only** the first input is connected. SimpleBlobDetector has the benefit of not requiring a known background to detect blobs but only returns blobs as a position and radius, meaning that all blobs rectangles will be square. The SimpleBlobDetector can also be quite slow so lowering the input resolution is often necessary. Generally this method should only be used if the background is not known.

### Background Subtraction

Background subtraction will automatically be used if there is a second input connected. Background subtraction is less dynamic and requires a known background to function but it offers a massive performance improvement over SimpleBlobDetector, and unlike with SimpleBlobDetector the blob rectangles using this method are not restricted to squares only. The background subtraction method will create a binary image from the first and second input (based off the threshold parameter) and then use OpenCV to find contours and convert those to rectangles.

## Parameters - Blob Track Page

Reset `reset` - Resets all tracking data and learned background data while this parameter is On.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets all tracking data and learned background data.
Mono Source `monosource` - ⊞ - Blob tracking is done using a single channel. This menu controls what single channel is used to detect blobs.

* Luminance `luminance` -

* Red `red` -

* Green `green` -

* Blue `blue` -

* Alpha `alpha` -

* RGB Average `rgbaverage` -

* RGBA Average `average` -

Draw Blob Bounds `drawblobs` - Draws rectangles on the TOP image that shows where the tracked blobs are.
Blob Bound Color `blobcolor` - ⊞ - Determines the color of the rectangles that are drawn to show the blobs.

* Red `blobcolorr` -

* Green `blobcolorg` -

* Blue `blobcolorb` -

Threshold `threshold` - Threshold used to create the binary texture when using background subtraction. It is the threshold of the difference between the background texture and the input texture.

## Parameters - Constraints Page

Minimum Blob Size `minblobsize` - Blobs must be at least this big to be tracked.
Maximum Blob Size `maxblobsize` - Blobs larger than this will not be tracked.
Maximum Move Distance `maxmovedistance` - The maximum distance a blob can move in one frame and still be considered to the same blob (maintain the same ID).
Delete Nearby Blobs `deletenearby` - Sometimes (depending on the tracking method) duplicate blobs may be created. This feature allows you to delete blobs that are too close to each other.
Minimum Distance `deletedist` - When deleting nearby blobs, blobs will be deleted if they are within this number of pixels of each other. The smaller blob will be deleted.
Delete Area Tolerance `deletenearbytol` - Along with the distance, the area of the two blobs can be compared. If this parameter is 1, than the area is ignored. As this parameter gets smaller only blobs that have a significant size difference (between the two blobs being compared) will be deleted.
Delete Overlapping Blobs `deleteoverlap` - Deletes blobs that are overlapping.
Delete Overlap Tolerance `deleteoverlaptol` - If this parameter is 1 then only blobs that are completely overlapped will be deleted. As this value gets smaller less and less overlap is needed for a blob to get deleted.

## Parameters - Revival Page

Revive Blobs `reviveblobs` - When enabled, will revive lost blobs (ie. same ID) if they satisfy all the below parameters
Revive Time `revivetime` - The time (in seconds) threshold for reviving a lost blob. If a blob has been lost for longer than revive time, it will not be revived and is considered expired.
Revive Area Difference `revivearea` - The area difference threshold for the new blob and the lost blob.
Revive Distance `revivedistance` - The distance threshold between the new blob and the lost blob.
Include Lost Blobs in Table `includelost` - When enabled, lost blobs will be included in the Blob Track TOP's Info DAT table.
Include Expired Blobs in Table `includeexpired` - When enabled, expired blobs (ie. blobs that have no chance of revival) will be included in the Blob Track TOP's Info DAT table.

Bloom TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bloom TOP

The Bloom TOP creates a glow effect around bright parts of the input image that simulates light bouncing around a lens assembly of a camera. Parameters control how much of the bright spots of your input image get bloomed, how wide the bloom gets spread, and how it rolls off into the un-bloomed areas.

The bloom starts with a **preprocessing stage** (Pre-Black Level, Pre-Gamma, and Pre-Brightness), (similar to the Black Level, Brightness, and Gamma parameters of a [Level TOP](Level_TOP.html "Level TOP")) which help to isolate the hot spots of the image that the bloom originates from (the Black Level), and boost the hot spots (Gamma and Brightness). (Switch the Output menu for a moment to Pre-Process to make sure you have a good signal to bloom with.)

The **second stage is a combination of scaled-down (blurred) levels** of the pre-processed image: The first level is the original pre-processed image, the second level is scaled down to half size (essentially 4 pixels averaged into one pixel), the third is the second level scaled down to half, and so on until the "top" level is 1x1 pixel (the average of the whole image.) For example, a 1024 x 1024 input images gives 10 levels. (These are called mipmaps.)

The second stage blends a range of scaled-down blur levels using the Min Bloom Radius and Max Bloom Radius parameters, where 0 refers to the first scaled-down level and 1 refers to the top scaled-down level. The Min and Max determine how dispersed or smeared the blooming is. Note: If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.

In the **third stage, the resulting bloom level is increased, reduced and shaped** using Bloom Threshold, Bloom S-Curve, Bloom Fill and Bloom Intensity. Typically the Fill and Intensity parameters should be adjusted first, and then some adjustment with Threshold, Min and Max, and with more finesse, the S-Curve if necessary.

Tip: If you want to bloom something and composite it over something else or a variant of the original, set the Output parameter to Bloom with Alpha and add it ([Add TOP](Add_TOP.html "Add TOP")) to something else.

## Parameters - Bloom Page

Pre-Black Level `preblacklevel` - Similar to the Black Level parameter of a Luma Level TOP. Pixels with a luminosity less than this value are pushed to black.
Pre-Gamma `pregamma` - Similar to the Gamma parameter of a Luma Level TOP, applies a gamma adjustment to the pixel value after the Pre-Black Level stage, which makes all non-zero values closer to RGB = 1, 1, 1.
Pre-Brightness `prebrightness` - Similar to the Brightness parameter of a Luma Level TOP, it is a multiplier for the pixel value after the Pre-Gamma stage.
Min Bloom Radius `minbloomradius` - Determines the minimum blur level to start sampling from. It is 0 to 1, so given a 1024x1024 image has 10 blur levels, if Minimum Bloom Size is set to .2, we will begin sampling from blur level 2 (the Pre-process image scaled to one quarter.) (The actual number of blur levels in the image is automatically determined by the image size.)
Max Bloom Radius `maxbloomradius` - Determines the maximum blur level we sample from. It is 0 to 1, so if the image has 10 blur levels and a Maximum Bloom Size is set to .8, we will sample mipmap levels up to level 8. If Max<Min, Max is set to Min.
Bloom Threshold `bloomthreshold` - After the blur levels have been mixed, this cuts away the darkest part of the image, or, when < 0, it adds more of the full-image average.
Bloom S-Curve `bloomscurve` - Reshapes the bloom rolloff so that it is tighter/steeper to the hot spots.
Bloom Fill `bloomfill` - Makes the bloom wider.
Bloom Intensity `bloomintensity` - Final multiplier of accumulated bloom value.
Output `output` - Permits the user to select the image that is output; useful for previewing the outputs of each stage of the bloom pipeline. If set to "Input", the original image is output; if set to "Preprocess", the preprocessed image is output; "Bloom" outputs only the bloom value with alpha = 1; "Bloom with Alpha" outputs only bloom value with its computed alpha (max of R G and B); and "Input + Bloom" (the default) outputs the combined source image and bloom image.
Input Image `inputimage0` - Multiplier for the input image value that is added in to the final bloom value.

Blur TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Blur TOP

The Blur TOP blurs the image with various kernel filters and radii. It can do multi-pass blurs and can do horizontal-only or vertical-only blurs.

Use Pre-shrink when the blurs are high and you want to optimize performance.

**Tip:** Filter Size is expressed in pixels. If you want resolution-independent blurs, use an expression like `me.par.resolutionw/100` in the Filter Size parameter, which gives a 1% image blur.

## Parameters - Blur Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - Determines how the blur is applied.

* Horizontal and Vertical `horzandvert` - Blur is applied in both x (horizontal) and y (vertical).

* Horizontal `horz` - Blur is applied in x direction only.

* Vertical `vert` - Blur is applied in y direction only.

Type `type` - ⊞ - Determines the mathematical function used to create the blur.

* Catmull-Rom `catmull` - A spline approximation to a Gaussian kernel. Gives sharper textures and more accurate edges.

* Gaussian `gaussian` - A normal distribution where pixels at the center have more effect on the resulting pixel. Gaussian lacks sharpness but handles ringing and aliasing well.

* Box `box` - Each pixel within the box is weighted evenly. Inexpensive and gives a "boxy" look.

* Bartlette `bartlette` - A triangle filter. The weight of each pixel is a linear function of its distance from the center.

* Sinc `sinc` - A sharpening filter. Some pixels contribute a negative weight to the result, artifacts may occur in the form of "ringing". Keeps small details and edges better than Gaussian.

* Hanning `hanning` - A cosine approximation to a Gaussian kernel.

* Blackman `blackman` - A higher order cosine approximation to a Gaussian kernel.

Extend `extend` - ⊞ - Sets the extend conditions to determine what happens to the blur at the edge of the image.

* Hold `hold` - The blur is clamped at the edges.

* Repeat `repeat` - The blur is calculated as if the image was repeating (tiled - blurring at the bottom of image that would fall outside the image edges will appear at top of image).

* Mirror `mirror` - The blur is calculated as if the image was mirrored and repeating.

Pre-Shrink `preshrink` - Reduces the image's resolution before applying the blur. This effectively applies a 2x2 box filter on the input and creates a smaller texture to do the full blur operation on. It behaves as if the kernel size is made larger, but has less of a performance impact, but also the blur isn't as high quality vs. actually increasing the kernel size.
Filter Size `size` - The amount of blur in pixels. If you want a resolution-independent blur, use an expression like `me.par.resolutionw/100` in this parameter (which would result in a 1% image blur).
Sample Step `offset` - ⊞ - When sampling the image, this determines the distance from each pixel to the sample pixel. When units are set to pixels, it is the number of pixels away from the current pixel which is sampled to blur the image. A Sample Step of 3 would sample pixels 3 pixels away.

* `offset1` -

* `offset2` -

Sample Step Unit `offsetunit` - Select between Pixel, Fraction, or Fraction Aspect as the units to use for the Sample Step parameter.
Rotate Kernel `rotate` - Rotates the blur filter. More noticeable when Method is set to Horizontal.
Dither `dither` - Enabling makes 8-bit blurs look smoother. This can help if the blur operation introduces banding or other unexpected artifacts.

Body Track CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Body Track CHOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This operator uses the [Augmented Reality (AR) SDK](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/maxine/ar-sdk-programming-guide/index.html) of the Nvidia Maxine system and requires a 20, 30, or 40 series Nvidia RTX GPU.

The Body Track CHOP can track bounding boxes and 34 key points of one or more human bodies, with optional joint angles, in 2D or 3D.

The input image is taken from a provided TOP and can be of any resolution or format, and either a still image or video.

The coordinates of the detected features are given in u, v positions relative to the bottom-left corner of the input image. By default, the values range from 0 to 1, but the 'Aspect Correct' parameter can be enabled to scale the values so that they can be used as 3D coordinates while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original image.

## Parameters - BodyTrack Page

Active `active` - Enables the body tracking features.
Model Folder `modelfolder` - The location of the AI model files used for body detection. By default these files are located in the Config/Models folder.
TOP `top` - A path to the TOP operator that provides the image to perform body tracking on.
High Performance `highperformance` - Enable high performance while sacrificing quality. This is only available when Keypoints are on.
Bounding Boxes `bbox` - Output channels that describe a bounding box around the detected body. The channels give the u and v positions of the center of the body as well as the width and height of the box. The positions are relative to the bottom-left corner of the input image.
Bounding Box Confidence `bboxconfidence` - Outputs a channel that describes the level of certainty that the AI model has detected a body in the input image. Higher numbers indicate greater confidence.
Keypoints `keypoints` - Outputs either the UV or XYZ positions of the body's keypoints, depending on whether Body 3D is enabled.
Keypoints Confidence `keypointsconfidence` - Outputs a channel that describes the level of certainty that the AI model has detected for each keypoint on a body. Higher numbers indicate greater confidence.
Rotations `rotations` - Output rx, ry, and rz values for each keypoint on the body. (0,0,0) indicates that the body is oriented directly towards the camera. Values can range from +/- 180 degrees.
Body 3D `body3d` - If keypoints are enabled, output XYZ positions instead of UV positions for each keypoint.
Field of View (Horz) `fov` - If Body 3D is enabled, fov is the Field of View of the camera which produced the image given to the Body Track.
Aspect Correct UVs `aspectcorrectuv` - Rescales the u and v positions so that they have the correct aspect ratio of the input image. This is useful when using the u, v positions as 3D coordinates rather than as image positions.
Mirror U Positions `flipskelu` - Flips the u-coordinate of the UVs so that 1.0 becomes 0. and 0. becomes 1.
People Tracking `peopletracking` - Track multiple people within the input image. Each person will have a persistent ID which is accessible with the Bounding Boxes toggle.
Max Bodies `maxbodies` - The maximum number of people for the Maxine SDK to track. After the new maximum target tracked limit is met, any new targets will be discarded. This parameter does not affect the number of output channels from the CHOP. There is no maximum to this parameter; however, the current version of the SDK can only track a maximum of 8 people at a time.
Shadow Tracking Age `shadowtrackingage` - Once a previously tracked body is no longer detected, an internal integer will be reset and incremented by one for each frame. The shadow tracking age is the threshold of this integer after which the body is discarded and no longer tracked. This property is measured in the number of frames, and the default is 90.
Probation Age `probationage` - This option is the length of the tracker's probationary period. After a body reaches this age, it is considered to be valid and is appointed an ID. This will help with false positives, where false bodies are detected only for a few frames. This is measured by the number of frames, and the default is 10.

Extra Information for the CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Bone COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bone COMP

The Bone Component is the foundation of all of the [Character Tools](https://docs.derivative.ca/Character_Tools "Character Tools"). It is a Component with most of the properties of a [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP"). It also has some extra features such as length, two types of geometry, end-to-end linking, and kinematic parameters.

The Bone Component is used to create hierarchies of limb-like objects that form part of a hierarchy or chain of Bone Components that are parented to one another. The movement of the chain of Bone Components is "solved" or computed based on several methods including Inverse Kinematics. The parenting attribute of bones is unique in that each bone attaches to the end, not the origin, of the parent bone.

It is recommended that you use the Bone Creation state, accessed through the state icons above the Viewport, to construct such a chain because placing individual Bone Components and establishing their parenting relationships from operator to operator is extremely time consuming and not at all intuitive. In addition, a chain created using the Bone state will produce a better behaved bone chain.

By default, bones do not render. They contain two types of display geometry: "link geometry" and "capture region geometry". The former consists of a narrow diamond shape which has been stretched to the length specified in *Bone Length*, and placed along the Bone Component's negative Z-axis. The latter consists of two or more user-controllable ellipses that are used to define capture regions used in skeleton sops. You can specify whether either of the two types of geometry are displayed.

The actual movement of the Bone Components is controlled through an IK CHOP (when using the standard Capture/Deform model). This is effected through an expression in the **Transform** channels of the Bone Component. If you want to override this behaviour, then you need to delete the bone's translate channels such that they are no longer over-ridden by chop control.

If you make a bone the child of a non-bone Component, then it will attach to the origin of that Component. If you want to reposition the bone relative to its non-bone parent, you must remove the expression in the bone's translate parameters.

## Parameters - Bone Page

Display Link `displaylink` - Enabling this option allows you to toggle the display of the link geometry in the Viewport on and off.
Rest Angles `restangles` - ⊞ - Defines the relative weighting of rotations about Rx, Ry, Rz, the bone's x,y,z axis for the Inverse Kinematics solver.

* X `restanglesx` -

* Y `restanglesy` -

* Z `restanglesz` -

Bone Length `length` - This parameter changes the overall length of the Bone Component. It affects the size of the bone geometry and the positioning of the capture geometry and also determines the "end" of the bone -- i.e. where Bone Components that are children of this bone will be positioned. By default, its end is oriented so that it lays along the local negative Z axis.
Dampening `ikdamp` - This parameter prevents bone chains from locking in a dramatically straight line when they are fully extended. This type of locking motion tends to make characters look robotic. The dampening field is a number between zero and one. The larger the number, the greater the dampening effect. Dampening is applied to the entire bone chain as the chain approaches its full extension. The end affector is thus allowed to drift off the end of the bone chain. The net effect is that when the chain is nearly fully extended, a relatively large end affector motion will cause a relatively small motion in the end of the chain. This gives the animator finer granularity in controlling the bone chain when it is fully extended.
X Angle Range `xrange` - ⊞ - Specifies the maximum and minimum rotation angles.

* `beginxrange` -

* `endxrange` -

X Damping Angle `xdamp` - Applies damping to the rotation of the bone when the rotation in each axis falls within the angle specified by X / Y Angle Range.
X Damping Rolloff `xrolloff` - Specifes the rate at which the damping increases as the rotation varies through the angle specifed by X / Y Angle Range.
Y Angle Range `yrange` - ⊞ - Specifies the maximum and minimum rotation angles.

* `beginyrange` -

* `endyrange` -

Y Damping Angle `ydamp` - Applies damping to the rotation of the bone when the rotation in each axis falls within the angle specified by X / Y Angle Range.
Y Damping Rolloff `yrolloff` - Specifes the rate at which the damping increases as the rotation varies through the angle specifed by X / Y Angle Range.

## Parameters - Capture Page

The Capture page is used to automatically create a capture region used by either the Capture or Deform sops (see [Capture SOP](Capture_SOP.html "Capture SOP") and [Deform SOP](Deform_SOP.html "Deform SOP") of the SOPs section). The capture region consists of at least two ellipses, and they may be translated along the bone's length.

Region Centre / Top Bottom Cap Heights

[![Objects13.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/5/5d/Objects13.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Objects13.gif)

All the geometry that is generated by the Bone Component is created using regular SOPs. Therefore, it is customisable by simply changing the Bone Component's SOP network. The bone's display can be easily altered by changing its contained SOPs.

Display Capture Geometry `displaycapture` -
Region Center `crcenter` - ⊞ - Position of the center of the region.

* X `crcenterx` -

* Y `crcentery` -

* Z `crcenterz` -

Top Height `crtopheight` - Height of the region from the centre to the top cap.
Top Cap `crtopcap` - ⊞ - The X, Y, Z radii of the top/bottom hemisphere.

* X `crtopcapx` -

* Y `crtopcapy` -

* Z `crtopcapz` -

Bot Height `crbotheight` - Height of the region from the centre to the top cap.

Bone Group SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bone Group SOP

The Bone Group SOP groups primitives by common bones (shared bones). This node often isn't needed in modern workflows with well made models.

This node will split the vertices into subsections, each of which are affected by a different subset of the bones of the skeleton. These are called Bone Groups. This SOP will split up geometry with capture attributes into different bone groups. The detail attributes pCaptData and pCaptPath will be split up into detail attributes with postfixes starting at 0. So for example if the geometry gets split into two bone groups, there will be detail attributes pCaptData0, pCaptPath0, pCaptData1, and pCaptPath1. The original pCaptData and pCaptPath will be deleted. The point/vertex attribute pCapt will become a vertex attribute named pCapt0, pCapt1 etc.. There will also be primitives groups named boneGroup0, boneGroup1 that contain all of the primitives in each bone group. All capture weights are re-normalized.

You should isolate out each of the primitive bone groups using the [Delete SOP](Delete_SOP.html "Delete SOP"). Next drop down a MAT (like the [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT")) that supports deforms. You will need to give the MAT a few pieces of information:

* The path to the SOP that contains the deform information you want this MAT to use. This is generally the Delete SOP, or some node after it.
* The name of the pCaptData and pCaptPath attribute. So for example if you are rendering bone group 0 with this MAT, you'd specify pCaptData0 and pCaptPath0.
* The path to the root of the skeleton.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[bonegroupSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/BonegroupSOP_Class "BonegroupSOP Class")

Max Bones per Point `bonesperpoint` - Trims the number of bones per point by ignoring the bones with the lowest weight until this maximum number is met.
Max Bones per Group `bonespergroup` - The maximum number of bones allowed per group of primitives. If there are more bones than this number, a new group is created.

Extra Information for the Bone Group SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Boolean SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Boolean SOP

The Boolean SOP takes two closed polygonal sets, A and B. Set these Sources to the SOPs with the 3D shapes that you wish to operate on. There are two important requirements for input geometry:

* Shapes must be completely closed. A tube with open ends is not an acceptable input. You can close Tube ends with an end-cap. An extruded letter with no back polygons output is also unacceptable (even with backs output it can be unacceptable because of the second requirement).
* All polygons must be convex and coplanar. In the case of the Extrude SOP, you must select Output Convex Faces for front and back faces. It will now be a usable input for Boolean. The Divide SOP also offers a convexing function for geometry not created with the Extrude SOP.

Other caveats for Boolean are the following:

* Point colors and texture UV coordinates are not interpolated correctly.
* In some cases polygons can be reversed so that all normals point outwards. The polygon reversal should not usually present much of a problem (use a Primitive SOP > Face/Hull page > Vertex > Reverse to reverse them if necessary).

* A [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP") can be used to prepare inputs when the Boolean SOP complaints they are not closed. In that case, use both the Consolidate Points and Orient Polygons options.

This SOP is quite visual and intuitive; you can experiment with the different combinations on screen to see the effects.

**Note:** The Boolean SOP handles polygonal geometry types. For boolean-type operations with nurbs and Bezier surfaces - see [Surfsect SOP](Surfsect_SOP.html "Surfsect SOP").

Operation `booleanop` - ⊞ - Some of the operations below produce guide geometry to give you visual feedback on the results of the operation being performed. The appearance of the geometry is context sensitive - if you are performing an intersect operation, or either of the edge operations the guide will be both inputs; if you are doing A minus B then the guide will be B and if B minus A then the guide will be A. If you are doing union then there will be no guide geometry.

If the guide geometry is too distracting, you can disable it by entering the Viewport options dialog and clicking on the Guide geometry button so that it no longer appears indented. This procedure is global and will disable the guide geometry of other SOPs as well.

The Boolean SOP will automatically orient polygons so they face the same way. This may not be enough in some cases because Boolean results in some unshared edges where the intersection cut took place. If the shading is still not good enough, you are best to follow Boolean with a Facet SOP. In it, Consolidate Points, Orient Polygons and finally Cusp.

If you have really strange shaped polygons, you can first triangulate one or both of the inputs with the Divide SOP.

* Union `union` - Geometry from the two inputs is combined, and interior polygons are removed. The result is a closed shape. This can be very useful for joining pipes or other shapes that the camera will travel inside, or where the intersecting shapes must be transparent. Points at the intersection of the shapes are not consolidated.

* Intersect `intersect` - The resulting geometry is a closed shape where the two input shapes overlap or intersect. Geometry outside the common area is discarded.

* A minus B `aminusb` - The result is a closed shape in which the geometry from B is cut away or subtracted from the geometry in A.

* B minus A `bminusa` - All operations same as previous three, but resulting shape is Part B with Part A cut away from it.

* A Edge `aedge` - Closed face(s) are produced, at the edges where the two parts meet. The face(s) can be twisted (not planar). The point order is unpredictable; append a Polygon SOP with the Order Points option enabled to sort them out if you want to make connections to the face.

Accurate Attributes Interpolation `accattrib` - If selected, all inputs are convexed to triangles, otherwise they are convexed to quadrilaterals.

Box SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Box SOP

The Box SOP creates cuboids. These can be used as geometries by themselves, or they can be sub-divided for use with the Lattice SOP.

If it has an input then it will create a box that bounds the incoming geometry. Otherwise, the parameters determine the size and location of the box.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[boxSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/BoxSOP_Class "BoxSOP Class")

Orient Bounds `orientbounds` - Available only when an input is connected to the Box SOP to set bounds for the box. When Orient Bounds = On it will rotate the geometry to match the orientation of the input SOP used for bounds.
Modify Bounds `modifybounds` - Available only when an input is connected to the Box SOP to set bounds for the box. When Modify Bounds = On to enable the transform parameters below to further modify the position and scale of the bounds.
Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - Sets the order in which the rotations are applied.

Size `size` - ⊞ - Size of the Box or Cube along the X, Y, and Z axes.

Consolidate Corner Points `consolidatepts` - Merges the corner points together. Instead of the box being composed of 6 separate faces (resulting in 4 points per corner and a total of 24 points), the corner points are merged together and the box is composed of 8 points.
Texture Coordinates `texture` - ⊞ - Determines how the texture coordinates are applied to the box.

* Box Inside `boxinside` -

* Face Inside `faceinside` -

* Cube Map Inside `cubemapinside` -

Bridge SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bridge SOP

The Bridge SOP is useful for skinning trimmed surfaces, holes, creating highly controllable joins between arms and body, branches or tube intersections.

The Bridge SOP is similar to the Skin SOP but with much greater control over the resulting surface. Given a set of profiles (i.e. curves on surface) and/or spatial faces, the Bridge SOP builds a NURBS skin with specified tangent and curvature characteristics. The precision of the resulting surface is highly dependent on the number of required cross-sections and on the quality of the profile extraction. High precisions will generate a very dense surface with, potentially, many multiple knots.

In general, the higher the order of the curve, the better the fit the Bridge SOP will be able to provide. However, it is generally better to stick to cubics (order 4) curves, as the software is optimized for cubics.

Because the Bridge SOP can join both a set of spatial curves and trim curves, it can be used much like the Skin SOP and/or the Fillet SOP. However, bridging trimmed surfaces is more expensive than bridging carved surfaces.

You will usually need a Trim, Bridge, or Profile SOP after a Project SOP.

* Use a Trim SOP to cut a hole in the projected surface
* Use a Bridge SOPto skin the profile curve to another profile curve.
* Use a Profile SOP to extract the curve on surface or remap it's position.

**Note:** To texture-map the resulting skin, use an Orthographic projection rather than a Spline-based projection. This results in better continuity across the surfaces.

Group `group` - The Group edit field allows you to enter profile groups for profiles and/or faces to bridge. This is optional if you have regular geometric curves or surfaces, however, you must enter something here in order for Bridge to work with profile curves. For example `*.0` will Bridge the 0th (first) profiles of all incoming primitives.

**Note:** Always specify the curves on surface if you want the Bridge SOP bridge curves on surfaces; otherwise it will attempt to bridge free-floating curves.

Bridge `bridge` - ⊞ - Allows bridging of subgroups of N primitives or patterns of primitives.

N `inc` - Determines the pattern of primitives to bridge using this SOP.
Order `order` - Sets the spline order for both profile extraction and skinning operations.

## Parameters - Surface Properties Page

Min X-Sections `isodivs` - The minimum number of cross-sections in the resulting skin. If you create a high-density surface, TouchDesigner's level of detail may display the surface less smoothly than it actually is. You can increase the level of detail by adjusting the viewdisplay options (e.g. `viewdisplay -l 1.5 SOPmain.persp1` ) for the Viewport.

**Production Tip:** If, in generating a smooth surface, you create an extremely complex surface, some of the complexity can be removed without damaging the appearance of the surface by appending a Refine SOP, and using its **Unrefine** option. In the Refine SOP, set the **First U** parameter to zero and, in the **Unrefine** option's parameters, set the **U** value close to the order of the surface created in the Bridge SOP.

Use `frenet` - ⊞ - Specifies the type of normal to use for computing direction:

* The Frenet Frame of the Face `frenet` - The Frenet Frame of the face. This option uses a local coordinate system on the curve to compute the direction.

* The Normal of the Face `normal` - The Normal of the face.

Circular Arc Fillet `circular` - Tells TouchDesigner to try to generate a round fillet rather than a free-form fillet. Only the sign (positive or negative) of the tangent scales is used; the scale magnitude is ignored when building a circular fillet.

The radius of the fillet is computed automatically and adjusted according to the distance between the rails (curves and/or profiles) and their tangents.

Rotate Tangents `rotatet` - ⊞ - The scaling and rotation parameters contain three fields. The rotation fields (degrees) apply further rotation to the tangents, while the scale parameter further scales the tangents.

* `rotatet1` - Applies to the first face in the input.

* `rotatet2` - Applies to all intermediate faces.

* `rotatet3` - Applies to the last face in the input.

Scale Tangents `scalet` - ⊞ - The scaling and rotation parameters contain three fields. The rotation fields (degrees) apply further rotation to the tangents, while the scale parameter further scales the tangents.

* `scalet1` - Applies to the first face in the input.

* `scalet2` - Applies to all intermediate faces.

* `scalet3` - Applies to the last face in the input.

Use Curvature `curvature` - Takes curvature into consideration as well.
Scale Curvatures `scalec` - ⊞ - Further scaling of the curvature.

**Note:** If the resulting skin bulges too greatly, you can achieve a smooth resulting transition between surfaces by disabling the Preserve Tangent & Preserve Curvature Magnitude parameters, and manually tweaking the Tangent Scales and the Curvature Scales. In general, avoid tweaking the Rotations of the Tangents unless you wish to deform the resulting surface.

If the bridge bulges on one side but not the other, try increasing the Min. Number of Cross sections in the bridge.

* `scalec1` -

* `scalec2` -

* `scalec3` -

## Parameters - Profile Extraction Page

This page's parameters are similar to those found in the Fit and Project SOPs.

Divisions per Span `sdivs` - Number of 2-D points evaluated in each span.
Tolerance `tolerance` - Precision of 2-D fitting algorithm.
Preserve Sharp Corners `csharp` - Enables or disables fitting of sharp turns. If cracks appear in the resulting skin, Preserve Sharp Corners is usually a good solution; however, it may add additional knots which can create undesirable "ripples" in some cases.

If this option is disabled, fewer isoparms are generated and the surface may not follow the contours of the profile curves perfectly unless the profile curves were built using the `Preserve Sharp Corners` option.

1. Place a Circle SOP. Primitive Type: NURBS; Radius = 0.2, 0.2
2. Place a Grid SOP. Primitive Type: NURBS.
3. Feed both the Circle and Grid SOPs into a Project SOP. Make it the display SOP. You notice the projected circle on the grid - our trim curve.
4. Append a Trim SOP and make it the display SOP. Turn on Gouraud shading for the Viewport - you now see the trimmed holes in the surface of the grid.
5. Append a Copy SOP. Number of Copies: 2; Translation Z: 1.0; Rotation X: 30. Make it the display SOP. Now we have two grids with trimmed holes in them.
6. Append a Bridge SOP, and make it the display SOP. Scale Tangents: `0, 0, 0`; Use Curvature: On; Preserve Curvature Magnitudes: Off; Scale Curvatures: `3, 3, 3` . Nothing happens. Why?
7. We need to specify which profile curves to skin. Turn on Profile Numbers in the Viewport options (click M at the bottom-right of Viewport, and enable the icon). We can see the profile numbers of the two trim curves are 0.0 and 1.0 - meaning the 0th profile of the 0th primitive and the 0th profile of the 1st primitive). The strange numbering is because primitive numbers start at 0 instead of 1.
8. In the Bridge SOP's Group field enter: `.0` - this means to include the 0th (first) curve from all (the *\** wildcard character) primitives in the skin. You now see the resulting bridge between the two trim curves. The skin bulges outwards.
9. We can control the bulge by playing with the Scale Curvatures and the Tangent Magnitudes. Set the Scale Curvatures to: `-3, -3, -3` . Now we have an inward-bulging tube connecting the two holes.  
   [![BridgeSOPExample.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/a/a3/BridgeSOPExample.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:BridgeSOPExample.gif)
10. Experiment with moving the location and size of the holes (change the Translation and Radius in the Circle SOP). The Bridge SOP dynamically updates the geometry connecting the two surfaces. Setting the Scale Curvature to: `0, 0, 0` produces a straight-through connection between the two holes.

Bullet Solver CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bullet Solver CHOP

The Bullet Solver CHOP is used in conjunction with a [Bullet Dynamics](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") system. It outputs the solved results from a Bullet simulation and can include the results for the entire system ([Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP")) or an individual actor ([Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP")) within a system.

The Bullet Solver CHOP can also be used with the "Feedback CHOP" parameter on the Bullet Solver COMP or Actor COMP. Bullet Solver simulation results can be grabbed using the Bullet Solver CHOP, modified, then fed back into the [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP") it came from. The values at the beginning of the next step of the simulation will be whatever values are in the CHOP that is fed back. This allows any CHOP data to be injected into the simulation at the beginning of the next frame (time step).

For example: making an actor in the simulation jump to the mouse cursor when clicked.

**Output Channels:**

* **actor\_id:** the OP id of the Actor COMP
* **body\_id:** the id of the body within the Actor COMP. Actor COMPs can have multiple bodies if they are static or if instancing (see: Actor COMP). Body id's increment from 0 to N-1, where N is the total number of bodies in an Actor COMP.
* **active:** whether the body is active in the simulation
* **colliding:** whether the body is currently colliding with another body
* **colliding\_actor\_id** the ID of the Actor COMP that contains the body we are colliding with
* **colliding\_body\_id** the ID of the body we are colliding with; together with colliding\_actor\_id will map back to a specific body in the simulation
* **total\_collisions:** the total number of collisions this body has had
* **t[xyz]:** the translation of the body in the given transform space
* **r[xyz]:** the rotation of the body in the given transform space
* **s[xyz]:** the scale of the body in the given transform space
* **vel\_t[xyz]:** linear velocity of the body
* **vel\_r[xyz]:** angular velocity of the body

Bullet Solver COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Bullet Solver COMP

In a [Bullet Dynamics](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") system, the Bullet Solver COMP is analogous to the world/simulation in which actors/bodies (ie. [Actor COMPs](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP")) operate. A Bullet Solver COMP contains any number of actors/bodies (Actor COMPs) or forces ([Force COMP](Force_COMP.html "Force COMP")/[Impulse Force COMP](Impulse_Force_COMP.html "Impulse Force COMP")), and as the name suggests it also uses the [Bullet Physics API](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/) to step through the simulation.

The Bullet Solver COMP runs a Bullet simulation based on some simulation parameters (eg. linear multiplier or angular multiplier) and updates the transformations of the Actor COMPs contained within it as the simulation progresses forward. The simulation can be paused, slowed down, sped up, or restarted using the parameters on the COMP.

The Bullet Solver COMP simulation operates in a vacuum, so there will be no air resistance applied to any actors in the simulation. The simulation is stepped at the given sample rate, and the Actor COMP transform is updated accordingly. These transformations are the same results displayed in the [Bullet Solver CHOP](Bullet_Solver_CHOP.html "Bullet Solver CHOP").

The Actor COMPs referenced by the Bullet Solver COMP do not need to be inside its network. They can be anywhere as long as they are not already referenced by another Bullet Solver COMP.

## Parameters - Solver Page

Actors `actors` - The Actor COMPs to include in the simulation. These actors cannot already be a part of another Bullet Solver COMP.
Global Forces `forces` - The Force COMPs to include in the simulation. These forces are global forces and will be applied to all non-static actors in the simulation.
Gravitational Acceleration `gravity` - ⊞ - Gravity applied to all actors in the simulation in m/s^2. Gravity is applied to actors irrespective of their mass.

* X `gravityx` -

* Y `gravityy` -

* Z `gravityz` -

Dimension `dimension` - ⊞ - The dimension of the simulation. The options in this menu can also be recreated using the linear/angular multiplier parameters.

* 1D `1d` - Actor is constrained to linear velocity only on the X axis, with no angular velocity (linmult 1,0,0 and angmult 0,0,0)

* 2D `2d` - Actor is constrained to linear velocity only on the XY plane, with angular velocity only around the Z axis (linmult 1,1,0 and angmult 0,0,1)

* 3D `3d` - Actor is not constrained and can move in any direction: X, Y, or Z. Similarly, the Actor can also rotate in any direction: X, Y, or Z (linmult 1,1,1 and angmult 1,1,1)

Linear Multiplier `linmult` - ⊞ - A multiplier for the linear velocities of the actors in the simulation. For example, if linmult is (0, 1, 1) then the actors can move linearly at normal speed on the Y and Z axes but cannot move in the X direction. These values are multiplied internally by the values from dimension. For example, if the dimension is 2D and linmult is (0, 1, 1) then the only direction the actors can move is along the Y axis because 2D is constraining on the Z and this parameter is constraining on the Y.

* X `linmultx` -

* Y `linmulty` -

* Z `linmultz` -

Angular Multiplier `angmult` - ⊞ - A multiplier for the angular velocities of the actors in the simulation. For example, if angmult is (1, 0, 0) then the actors can only rotate on the X axes. These values are multiplied internally by the values from dimension. So, if dimension is 2D and angmult is (1, 0, 0) then the actor will not be able to rotate in any direction because 2D constrains rotation only to the Z axis, and this parameter is constraining it only to the X axis.

* X `angmultx` -

* Y `angmulty` -

* Z `angmultz` -

Initialize Sim and Collision Shapes `initall` - Resets all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity) and recreates their collision shapes. This parameter is equivalent to pulsing each Actor COMP's "Initialize Actor". Creating collision shapes can be time consuming in certain cases, so if it's not need then Initialize Sim should be used instead. Collision shapes need to be recreated if any of the SOPs used to create the collision shape change, or if the instancing OP changes.
Initialize Sim `init` - Reset all bodies to their initial state (ie. position, orientation, velocity). This will not begin stepping through the simulation, it will only initialize. **NOTE:** This will not reset the collision shapes of any Actor COMPs, "Initialize Sim and Collision Shapes" above or "Initialize Actor" on the Actor COMP should be used for that.
Start Sim `start` - Initialize the simulation and run it (begin stepping).
Play `play` - Play the simulation. Will step through the simulation when toggled on, but will not when it is toggled off (ie. it will be paused).
Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the simulation. The sample rate affects the timestep, which is 1/rate
Simulation Speed `simspeed` - The speed of the simulation. It is a multiplier for the size of the timestep to slow down or speed up the simulation.
Feedback CHOP `feedback` - (see also: [Bullet Solver CHOP](Bullet_Solver_CHOP.html "Bullet Solver CHOP")) A reference to a CHOP to feedback. The Bullet Solver COMP will take the transform/velocity channels from the CHOP and override the respective actor's transform or velocity at the beginning of the next simulation step.

If you feedback a Bullet Solver CHOP that has no change to the channel values in it, the simulation will act as normal as nothing is being overriden. This allows you do things like the example below.
For example, to negate the velocity of every actor in a simulation you could use a Bullet Solver CHOP, put that into a Switch CHOP with the second input being the same CHOP only with the velocity channels negated. Then export a button pulse to the switch index and put the Switch CHOP into the Feedback CHOP parameter. Then, when the button is pressed for a single frame (pulsed) the velocities will be overridden and negated.
The only channels required to feedback are the actor\_id and body\_id channels, all other channels are optional. The channel names should all be the same as in the Bullet Solver CHOP. In addition to the channels outputted in the Bullet Solver CHOP, force and torque can also be used. The channel names are **force[xyz]** and **torque[xyz]**. **NOTE:** scale cannot be used for feedback.

Perform Contact Test `contacttest` - Enables contact testing for all bodies in the simulation. Contact testing is used for the colliding and total\_collisions channels on the Bullet Solver CHOP. Without this parameter enabled those channel values will not update. **NOTE:** Contact testing can be slow for lots of bodies.
Always Simulate `alwayssim` - When enabled the Bullet Solver COMP will simulate (ie. cook) every frame.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - A reference to a DAT with python callbacks. The available callbacks are: `onCollision(solverComp, collisions)`, `onFrameStart(solverComp)`, `onFrameEnd(solverComp)`, `onInit(solverComp)`, `onStart(solverComp)`. A DAT with these callbacks will be automatically created and referenced when a Bullet Solver COMP is created. `onCollision(solverComp, collisions)` passes a list of all collisions occuring, and requires that Perform Contact test be enabled. `collisions` is a list of named tuples (`bodyA` and `bodyB`). `bodyA` and `bodyB` are the two bodies participating in the collision. `bodyA` and `bodyB` are Python Body Objects (see [Body Class](Body_Class.html "Body Class")).

Button Group DAT `buttongroupdat` - Specify a [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") that lists all buttons in a radio group. This allows a group of radio buttons to have its member buttons located in any network - the buttons do not have to be in the same component. The paths are relative to the DAT and can contain patterns and wildcards (see [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching")). When a button is activated, it modifies the radio panel values of the DAT's parent, not its own parent, since buttons can now be scattered in different components.
Color `color` - ⊞ - RGB tone for the button elements

* Red `colorr` -

* Green `colorg` -

* Blue `colorb` -

## Parameters - Layout Page

The Layout parameter page controls the size and position of the panel.

X `x` - Specify the horizontal position in pixels relative to its parent.
Y `y` - Specify the vertical position in pixels relative to its parent.
Width `w` - Specify the panel's width in pixels.
Height `h` - Specify the Panel's height in pixels.
Fixed Aspect `fixedaspect` - ⊞ - Allows easy creation of panels with a specific aspect set in the Aspect Ratio parameter below. Only requires setting the width or height of the panel and the other dimension is calculated based on the Aspect Ratio parameter.

* Use Horizontal `horizontal` -

* Use Vertical `vertical` -

Aspect Ratio `aspect` - Specify the ratio when using Fixed Aspect parameter above, the ratio is width/height.
Depth Layer `layer` - Specifies the order the panel components are drawn in, similar to layers in Photoshop. Higher values will be drawn over any other panel with a lower value (that is at the same level of hierarchy). If two panel components have the same Depth Layer value then they are ordered based on the operator's name.
Horizontal Mode `hmode` - ⊞ - Select one of 3 modes to determine the horizontal width of the panel.

* Fixed Width `fixed` - Uses the Width parameter above to set this panel's width in pixels.

* Fill `fill` - The width of this panel will match (fill) the width of the parent panel.

* Anchors `anchors` - The width of this panel is set by the Left Anchor and Right Anchor parameters below which will maintain a relative width to the parent panel as the parent panel changes size. This allows for stretchy panels. These anchor parameters are normalized 0-1 like uv coordinates where 0 is the left edge and 1 is the right edge of the parent panel. For example, Left Anchor = 0.2 and Right Anchor = 0.8 will maintain the width proportionally to the parent panel such that the left edge is 20% (0.2) in from the left and the right edge is 20% (0.8) in from the right.

Left Anchor `leftanchor` - Position of the left anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the left edge of the parent and 1 is the right edge of the parent.
Left Offset `leftoffset` - An offset for the left anchor in pixels.
Right Anchor `rightanchor` - Position of the right anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the left edge of the parent and 1 is the right edge of the parent.
Right Offset `rightoffset` - An offset for the right anchor in pixels.
Horizontal Origin `horigin` - Sets the position of the panel's origin horizontally. The default origin (0,0) is the bottom-left corner of the panel.
Horizontal Fill Weight `hfillweight` - When multiple panels are using Horizontal Mode = Fill and being aligned by the parent either Left to Right or Right to Left, this fill weight parameter can be used to bias the fill width of the panels.
Vertical Mode `vmode` - ⊞ - Select one of 3 modes to determine the vertical height of the panel.

* Fixed Height `fixed` - Uses the Height parameter above to set this panel's height in pixels.

* Fill `fill` - The height of this panel will match (fill) the height of the parent panel.

* Anchors `anchors` - The height of this panel is set by the Bottom Anchor and Top Anchor parameters below which will maintain a relative and proportionally height to the parent panel as the parent panel changes size. This allows for stretchy panels. These anchor parameters are normalized 0-1 like uv coordinates where 0 is the bottom edge and 1 is the top edge of the parent panel. For example, Bottom Anchor = 0.3 and Right Anchor = 0.5 will maintain the height proportionally to the parent panel such that the bottom edge is 30% (0.3) up from the bottom and the top edge is 50% (0.5) down from the top.

Bottom Anchor `bottomanchor` - Position of the bottom anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the bottom edge of the parent and 1 is the top edge of the parent.
Bottom Offset `bottomoffset` - An offset for the bottom anchor in pixels.
Top Anchor `topanchor` - Position of the top anchor of the panel with respect to the parent. This value is normalized 0-1, 0 is the bottom edge of the parent and 1 is the top edge of the parent.
Top Offset `topoffset` - An offset for the top anchor in pixels.
Vertical Origin `vorigin` - Sets the position of the panel's origin vertically. The default origin (0,0) is the bottom-left corner of the panel.
Vertical Fill Weight `vfillweight` - When multiple panels are using Vertical Mode = Fill and being aligned by the parent either Top to Bottom or Bottom to Top, this fill weight parameter can be used to bias the fill height of the panels.
Parent Alignment `alignallow` - ⊞ - When set to Ignore, the Panel will ignore any Align parameter settings from its parent.

* Allow `allow` - Aligns the panel based on settings in parent.

* Ignore `ignore` - Does not align the panel but respects margins.

* Ignore and Ignore Margins `ignoremargin` - Does not align the panel and disregards margins.

Align Order `alignorder` - This parameter allows you to specify the align position when its parent's Align parameter is set to something other then **None** or **Match Network Nodes**. Lower numbers are first.
Post Offset `postoffset` - ⊞ - Adds an offset after all other postions and alignment options have been applied to the panel.

* X `postoffsetx` -

* Y `postoffsety` -

Size from Window `sizefromwindow` - When enabled the panel component's width and height are set by resizing its floating viewer window.

Vertical Scrollbar `pvscrollbar` - ⊞ - Setting for vertical scrollbar on this panel.

* Automatic `auto` - Include scrollbar only when child height is greater than this panel's height.

Thickness `scrollbarthickness` - Set the thickness of the scrollbars in pixels.

## Parameters - Drag/Drop Page

Please refer to [Drag-and-Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html "Drag-and-Drop") for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.

When Dragging This `drag` - ⊞ - Specify if this Panel Component can be dragged.

* Use Parent's Drag Settings `dragparent` - Follow the parent Panel Components Drag setting.

* Legacy Drag System `legacy` - Allow Dragging for this Panel Component. Use the Paramters `Drag Script`, `Drop Destination Script` and `Dropped Operator` to control the behaviour.

* Do Not Allow Drag `dragno` - Disallows Dragging for this Panel Component.

Drag Script `dragscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when starting to drag a Panel Component. Please refer to the Drag Script section of the [Drag and Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drag_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Drop Destination Script `dropdestscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when the dragged Panel Component is dropped. A temporary network is created and the component (or the alternative operator specified in Dropped Component) is copied to this network. You can add or modify operators in this network. Please refer to the Drop Destination Script section of the [Drag and Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drop_Destination_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Drop Types `droptypescript` - If a drop destination script is specified, you can also add a DAT table with a list of return types that the drop destination script will provide. Return types can be one of the op types (COMP,TOP,CHOP,SOP,MAT,DAT), channel, or supported filetypes. Please refer to the Drop Types section of the [Drag and Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drop_Types "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Dropped Operator `paneldragop` - The Dropped Component parameter is the easiest way to specify an alternative operator to drop. Note that this alternative operator must exist, otherwise the component itself will be dropped. The alternative is only used when dropping onto a network or control panel. Text pasted via dragging and dropping, or files saved via dropping onto the desktop, will still use the original.
On Dropping Into `drop` - ⊞ - Specify if this Panel Component accepts items that are dropped onto it.

* Use Parent's Drop Settings `dropparent` - Follow the parent Panel Components Drop setting.

* Legacy Drop System `legacy` - Allow Dropping onto this Panel Component. Use the Paramter `Drop Script` to control the behaviour.

* Do Not Allow Drop `dropno` - Disallows Dropping onto this Panel Component.

Drop Script `dropscript` - A component's Drop Script is run when you drop another component or an external file into that component. Please refer to the Drop Scripts - Text section of the [Drag and Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drop_Scripts_-_Text "Drag-and-Drop") page.

Alternatively specify a Table DAT in the drop script field. TouchDesigner will automatically look for 2 columns in the table. The first column should indicate the data type and the second should indicate the Text DAT that holds the script to process that data type. Please refer to the Drop Script - Tables section of the [Drag and Drop](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drop_Script_-_Tables "Drag-and-Drop") page.

This gives direct, random access to any image stored in a Cache TOP.The Cache Select TOP grabs an image from a [Cache TOP](Cache_TOP.html "Cache TOP") based on the index parameter. This gives direct, random access to any image stored in a Cache TOP.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[cacheselectTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/CacheselectTOP_Class "CacheselectTOP Class")

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Cache Select Page](#Parameters_-_Cache_Select_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Common Page](#Parameters_-_Common_Page)
* [4 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [4.1 Common TOP Info Channels](#Common_TOP_Info_Channels)
  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Cache Select Page

Cache TOP `cachetop` - Specify which Cache TOP to grab the image from.
Cache Index `index` - Specify the image to grab from the sequence of cached images. The index starts at 0, which is the current image. Images are then accessed backwards in time, such that the image before the current image has an index of -1, the image before that has an index of -2, and so on.

* Fit Resolution `fit` - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same.

* Limit Resolution `limit` - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same.

* Custom Resolution `custom` - Directly control the width and height.

* Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses  [mipmap](Mipmapping.html "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).

Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the [GLSL TOP](GLSL_TOP.html "GLSL TOP") when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected TOP's image.
Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
Pixel Format `format` - ⊞ - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](Pixel_Formats.html "Pixel Formats") for more information.

* sRGB 8-bit fixed (RGBA) `srgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does **not** apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to [sRGB](https://docs.derivative.ca/SRGB "SRGB").

Cache SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Cache SOP

The Cache SOP collects its input geometry in a cache for faster random-access playback of multiple SOPs. It should be used when cook times for a chain of SOPs is long and a quicker playback is needed.

Once cached, the geometries can be accessed in any order. This is advantageous to a 2D flipbook or scene render since the geometry is still fully 3-Dimensional. The upshot being that you can scrub otherwise sluggish animations in real time because things are precomputed and stored in a cache.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[cacheSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/CacheSOP_Class "CacheSOP Class")

Active `active` - While On, this node will cache a single snapshot of it's input's geometry each cook.
Pre-Fill `prefill` - Cooks 'Cache Size' number of times to fill the Cache SOP with geometry. When set > 0, it will fill the cache. If set > 0 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set > 0 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. While this is > 0, the node behaves as if the 'On' parameter is 0. If set to 0, then back > 0, it will clear the previous data, and pre-fill again. For more information refer to the [Pre-Filling](Pre-Filling.html "Pre-Filling") article.
Cache Size `cachesize` - The size of the cache.
Step Size `step` - The number of frames that the node will cook before it caches another geometry. When set to 1, it will cache every cook, when set to 2, it will cache every two cooks, etc.
Output Index `outputindex` - Determines which cached geometry to output. 0 is the most recent cached geometry. Valid values are between 0 and cachesize - 1.
Cache Points Only `cachepoints` - Store a single topology for the first cached geometry and only point data for the remaining geometries.
Blend Position `blendpos` - Interpolate points between geometries.
Reset `reset` - When On, clears out all of the cached geometry.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly clears out all of the cached geometry.

Extra Information for the Cache SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Cache TOP

The Cache TOP stores a sequence of images into GPU memory. These cached images can be read by the graphics card much faster than an image cache in main memory or reading images off disk.

The Cache TOP can be used to freeze images in the TOP by turning the Active parameter Off. (You can set the cache size too `1`.)

The Cache TOP acts as a delay if you set Output Index to negative numbers and leave the Active parameter On.

Once a sequence of images has been captured by turning the Active parameter On or toggling the Active Pulse parameter, they can be looped by animating the Output Index parameter.

## Parameters - Cache Page

Active `active` - While this is On, the Cache TOP will capture images into its memory.
Active Pulse `activepulse` - Captures an image for the single frame this was pulsed.
Get One Image on Startup `cacheonce` - Checking this On will cook the TOP once after startup to load an initial image.
Replace Single `replace` - While this is On, the Cache TOP will replace the image at 'Replace Index' with the input image. This allows you to replace specific images in the cache at will.
Replace Pulse `replacespulse` - Replace an image for the single frame this was pulsed.
Replace Index `replaceindex` - Select the image index that will be replaced by the input, when 'Replace Single' is turned on.
Pre-Fill `prefill` - Cooks 'Cache Size' number of times to fill the Cache TOP with images. When set to 1, it will fill the cache. If set to 1 during playback, it will fill immediately. If set to 1 and saved out, then next time the file is opened the cache will pre-fill. While this is > 0, the node behaves as if the Active parameter is Off. If set to 0, then back > 0, it will clear the previous data, and pre-fill again. For more information refer to the [Pre-Filling](Pre-Filling.html "Pre-Filling") article.
Pre-Fill Pulse `prefillpulse` - Pre-fills a single image during the frame this was pulsed.
Cache Size `cachesize` - Determines the number of images that can be stored in this Cache TOP.
Step Size `step` - The number of cooks that go by before the Cache TOP grabs an image. A Step Size of 2 will cache an image every 2nd cook, a Step Size of 3 will cache every 3rd cook, and so on.
Output Index `outputindex` - Determines which image in cache the TOP outputs. 0 is the most recent image, negative integers output image further back in time.
Output Index Unit `outputindexunit` - Sets the units used in the Output Index parameter.
Interpolate Frames `interp` - When On (On = 1), the Cache TOP will interpolate between frames when non-integer values are used in the Output Index parameter. For example, a value of -0.5 in Output Index will output a blended image of the most recent frame (0.0) and the second most recent frame (-1.0).
Always Cook `alwayscook` - Forces the operator to cook every frame.
Reset `reset` - While On this will empty the cache of stored images and release the memory held by the TOP.
Reset `resetpulse` - Instantly empty the cache.

Camera Blend COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Camera Blend COMP

The Camera Blend Component blends the 3D object transforms and viewing settings of multiple Camera Components together. It gives you some extra flexibility in setting up parent-child relationships. It operates like the [Switch SOP](Switch_SOP.html "Switch SOP") and [Sequence Blend SOPs](Sequence_Blend_SOP.html "Sequence Blend SOP") insofar as it takes more than one input and blends or switches those into one output.

The Camera Blend COMP can animate camera parameters and positions between various cameras.

To set up, wire the bottom connector of a Camera COMP to the top input of the Camera Blend COMP. Then for another Camera COMP, wire its bottom connector to the top of the Camera Blend COMP. Then you can adjust the Weight parameters of the Camera Blend COMP.

The View and Background parameter pages are used as the camera parameters when non-Camera COMPs are connected to the Camera Blend COMP.

See also [Blend COMP](Blend_COMP.html "Blend COMP").

Camera COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Camera COMP

The Camera Component is a 3D object that behaves like a real-world camera. You view your scene through it and render from its point of view using a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP").

See [Geometry Viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer") to learn about how you can inspect a scene from a camera.

See [cameraViewport](Palette_camera.html "Palette:camera") in the Palette - it's a powerful interactive camera that can be used in place of the basic Camera COMP.

A Camera Component can be attached or linked to any other 3D Component in a [3D hierarchy](3D_Parenting.html "3D Parenting").

Projection `projection` - ⊞ - A pop-up menu lets you choose from Perspective and Orthographic projection types. A third option Perpective to Ortho Blend enables the Projection Blend parameter below which can be used to blend between perspectives. A 4th option Custom Projection Matrix allows you to specify a custom 4x4 projection matrix using a tdu.Matrix, CHOP or a DAT.

Projection Blend `projectionblend` - Blends between perspective projection and orthographic projection when the Projection parameter is set to Perspective to Ortho Blend.
Ortho Width `orthowidth` - Only active if Orthographic is chosen from the Projection pop-up menu. This specifies the width of the orthographic projection.
Viewing Angle Method `viewanglemethod` - ⊞ - This menu determines which method is used to define the camera's angle of view.

* Horizontal FOV `horzfov` - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view horizontally.

* Vertical FOV `vertfov` - Uses the FOV Angle parameter below to set the camera's angle of view vertically.

* Focal Length and Aperture `focalaperture` - Uses the Focal Length and Aperture parameters below to define the camera's angle of view.

FOV Angle `fov` - The field of view (FOV) angle is the angular extend of the scene imaged by the camera.

**Useful Equations**

Field of View and Throw Angle: The FOV would be:

FOV = arctan( (screenWidth / 2) / (distanceToScreen) ) \* 2
FOV = arctan( 0.5 \* (screenWidth / distanceToScreen) ) \* 2

Throw is:

Throw = distanceToScreen / screenWidth
1/Throw = screenWidth / distanceToScreen

In terms of throw, it's

FOV = arctan(0.5 \* (1/Throw)) \* 2
FOV = arctan(0.5 / Throw) \* 2

**FOV calculations in x and y**

The above equations can be used to determine FOV\_x and FOV\_y (ie. horizontally and vertically) using Comera COMP parameters focal and aperture. In TouchDesigner's Camera COMP, screenWidth = aperture parameter and distanceToScreen = focal parameter (assuming infinity focus), from this

FOV\_x = arctan( (aperture / 2) / focal) \* 2

Furthermore, as mentioned above aperture parameter = aperture\_x and if given the resolution in x and y of the rendered view (ie. aspect ratio)

aperture\_y = resy/resx \* aperture\_x

From this

FOV\_y = arctan( (aperture\_y / 2) / focal ) \* 2
Focal Length `focal` - The parameter sets the focal length of the lens, zooming in and out. Perspective is flattened or exaggerated depending on focal length. See FOV Angle parameter for relation of aperture, focal length and field of view angle. Some interesting distortion effects can be acheived with this parameter.
Aperture `aperture` - This value relates to the area through which light can pass for the camera.
Near `near` - This control allows you to designate the near clipping planes. Geometry closer from the lens than these distances will not be visible.

Window Roll Pivot `winrollpivot` - ⊞ -

* Viewport Origin `viewport` -

* Camera Origin `camera` -

* Legacy Behavior `legacy` -

Window X/Y `win` - ⊞ - These parameters define the center of the window during the rendering process. The window parameter takes the view and expands it to fit the camera's field of vision. It is important to note that this action is independent of perspective. In other words, it acts as though you are panning the camera without actually moving the camera. The units for this parameter are normalized. That is a Window X of -0.5 will move the previous center of the image to the left edge of the render.

Window Size `winsize` - The Window Size parameter specifies the dimensions for expanding the view. Similar to Window X / Y, this parameter creates a zoom effect by scaling the screen before rendering to the viewport.
Window Roll `winroll` - This parameter sets the amount, in degrees, the window area rolls. This can be set as a static value or as an aspect that changes over the course of the animation. The roll occurs about the centre of the window.
IPD Shift `ipdshift` - This is the Interpupillary Distance which applies a translation on the X axis. It is separate from the other translations because when doing things such as a Cube Map rendering, the shift needs to occur after the rotation to the other cube face. If you apply the shift directly in the X translate parameter the cameras will be in the incorrect spot for many of the cube faces.

To use the IPD with 2 cameras, the right eye camera should be set with +IPD/2 and the left eye camera to -IPD/2.

Proj Matrix/CHOP/DAT `projmatrixop` - When Custom Projection Matrix is selected, this parameters should be filled in a custom 4x4 projection matrix. For ways to specify a matrix in a parameter, refer to the [Matrix Parameters](Matrix_Parameters.html "Matrix Parameters") article. The projection matrix should generate depth values in Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL clip range [-1,1].
Custom Projection GLSL DAT `customproj` - Takes a DAT containing a GLSL shader to specify custom projection functions. You must provide one functions in this shader. As a starting point, here are the definitions for the function that is used when custom ones are not provided. This will only be used when the Render TOP is rendering a 2D output, not cubemaps or fisheye renders. Note that projection works using Vulkan depth clip range [0,1], not OpenGL's [-1,1]. So the position will be clipped when z is outside the range 0 <= z <= w.
```
 vec4 UserWorldToProj(vec4 worldSpaceVertPosition, int cameraIndex)			
 {			
     vec4 projP = uTDMats[cameraIndex].camProj * worldSpaceVertPosition;			
     return projP;			
 }

`vec3 TDWorldToProj()` will automatically call this at the appropriate point. You can use uniforms/samplers in this shader code by declaring them here and providing them in the GLSL page of the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP").

Quad Reproject SOP `quadreprojsop` - [Quad Reprojection](Quad_Reprojection.html "Quad Reprojection") is a feature that allows reprojection an arbitrary quad in the scene so that portion of the render where it ends up will be blown up to fill the output of the render. Refer to the [Quad Reprojection](Quad_Reprojection.html "Quad Reprojection") article for more information about this feature.
Quad Reproject Points `quadreprojpts` - ⊞ - Specifies 4 point indices in the SOP referenced by Quad Reproject SOP that make up the quad that determines the region to be reprojected. The indices should be listed in bottom left, bottom right, top left, top right order, as viewed from the camera. The SOP that is referenced should be in the COMP that is being rendered, so the world transform that will be applied to is can be taken into account.

* Quad Reproject Points 1 `quadreprojpts1` -

* Quad Reproject Points 2 `quadreprojpts2` -

* Quad Reproject Points 3 `quadreprojpts3` -

* Quad Reproject Points 4 `quadreprojpts4` -

Background Color `bgcolor` - ⊞ - Sets the background color and alpha of the camera's view.

Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.
Fog `fog` - ⊞ - This menu determines the type of fog rendered in the viewport: **Linear** fog uses the following equation:

**Exponential** fog uses the following equation:

Fog Alpha `fogalpha` - Used to control the background opacity of the scene.
Fog Map `fogmap` - Use a TOP texture as a color map for the fog.
Camera Light Mask `camlightmask` - Allows only specific [lights](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") to be used by this camera. This is used in conjunction with the Lights parameter in the Render TOP to determine what lights are used to illuminate the geometry. When this parameter is left blank, all lights specified in the Render TOP will be used. Lights specified in this parameter will limit the geometry's lighting with this camera to the light(s)specified assuming the light(s) is also listed in the Render TOP.

Cap SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Cap SOP

The Cap SOP is used to close open areas with flat or rounded coverings. Meshes are capped by extending the mesh in either the U or V direction (e.g. a NURBS tube). Faces are capped by appending a separate face or hull cap.

# Capture Region SOP

The Capture Region SOP defines capture region (cregion), which is a type of primitive which can be thought of as a modified tube primitive (a tube with half a sphere on either end). The hemispheres on the ends of the tubes are called "caps". Like any other primitive, each Capture Region has a primitive number and can be assigned primitive attributes. A Capture Region is simply a volume which is used to define the point capture weighting for a geometry. It is then animated to deform the geometry.

Capture Regions are always shown in wireframe (even in shaded mode) so that you can focus on the geometry for which the region will act on.

## Parameters - Region Page

There are parameters to control the size, shape and position of the capture region. There are separate controls for the top and bottom half of the region. This allows you to edit one side of the bone at a time as you work through your character.

The Max/Min Weight parameter is used in the weighting of points. The closer a point is to the edge of the region, the smaller it's weight will be. By default the weight is 1 along the center axis of a region (more on this later), and 0 at the edge of the region. You can modify these weight extremities by through this parameter.

Orientation `orient` - ⊞ - Defines the direction axis of the region. Use Z axis when the region is inside a bone object.

* X `tcapx` -

* Y `tcapy` -

* Z `tcapz` -

Bottom Cap `bcap` - ⊞ - The X, Y, Z radii of the top/bottom hemisphere.

* X `bcapx` -

* Y `bcapy` -

* Z `bcapz` -

Max/Min Weight `weight` - ⊞ - Defines the weight of a point exactly on the centre line and edge of the region respectively. Point weights in-between are blended.

* `weight1` -

* `weight2` -

## Parameters - Display Page

Display Color `color` - ⊞ - The Capture Region SOP<uses region colors for helpful feedback.

By default the region inherits the color of its containing object (via an expression).

## How Weighting is Calculated

Weighting is based on distance to the center line of the region. The center line's length is the height of the tube and runs down its center. When viewed in cross-section, the distance is measured perpendicular to the center line for the tube section and radially for the hemisphere region. This scheme is shown below. The lines represent the distance of points along the edge of the region.

This weighting scheme gives continuous deformations to NURBS surfaces when the end cap section of one region is sized so that it touches the middle section of the next region, as shown below.

Capture SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Capture SOP

The Capture SOP is used to weight points in a geometry to capture regions. The weighting scheme is described in the next section, [Capture Region SOP](Capture_Region_SOP.html "Capture Region SOP").

The weights and the regions they correspond to are transferred down the SOP chain as point and detail attributes.

The Capture SOP can take an optional second input to specify extra capture regions to use in the capture process. Any capture regions that are in this second input are processed after the capture regions that are in the object hierarchy specified by the Hierarchy parameter. You can also specify a second input and not specify a Parent Object at all.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[captureSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/CaptureSOP_Class "CaptureSOP Class")

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Capture Page](#Parameters_-_Capture_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Override Page](#Parameters_-_Override_Page)
* [4 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group `group` - Specify the point groups from the first input (input0) to operate on.
Hierarchy `rootbone` - An object hierarchy is traversed to find the Capture Regions with which to do the weighting. This parameter specifies the top of the traversal hierarchy.
Weight from `weightfrom` - ⊞ - Use this menu to specify where to get the weight from.

* Surface `surface` - (default) Uses the surface to compute the weight of a point (or CV in the case of NURBS). This is very helpful for NURBS surfaces when the CV's may be far off the surface. By using Weight From Surface, each CV is weight based on the surface's location within a Capture Region. This is determined by calculating the CVs "most influenced point" on the NURBS surface and computing the weight of that position.

* Points `cv` - Using the Weight From Points choice, the location of the point within the region is used for the weighting.

Capture Frame `captframe` - Specifies the frame number to do the capture computations. Every time TouchDesigner reaches this frame, the geometry will be re-captured. It is a common practice to set the Capture Frame to an frame outside of your animation range, -1 for example. Specifies the frame number to do the capture computations. Every time TouchDesigner reaches this frame, the geometry will be re-captured. It is a common practice to set the Capture Frame to an frame outside of your animation range, -1 for example.

**Note:** When a .toe file is loaded, all of the associated capture regions are evaluated at the Capture Frame. Keyframes must be set to position the capture regions properly at the Capture Frame, otherwise the geometry will be weighted incorrectly upon the subsequent file loads.

Point Coloring `color` - ⊞ - This option colors each point by capture region (using point attributes) according to its capture weight. The points inherit their colors from the Capture Region(s) in which they lie. For example, if a point falls within a blue capture region and also a yellow capture region, the point will be colored green (more blue near if the blue weighting dominates, and more yellow if the yellow weight dominates). In addition, the points become darker as the weighting gets lighter. For example, near the edge of a blue region, a caught point will appear dark blue. Near the centre, it will appear bright blue. If a point is not caught by any region, it is colored bright red.

* Default Source Color `coldefault` -

* Color by Capture Region `colregion` -

Override File `captfile` - The name of the capture override file (`*.ocapt`). This file is loaded after TouchDesigner completes its point weighting. Each line of the override file lists a point number, a region (path and primitive number) and a weight. The points on the geometry are modified to use these custom weights.

**Override File Format** - Each line in the override file must have the following format:

For example:

```
0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 0.0 			
0 /obj/chain_bone2/cregion 0 3.757989 			
0 /obj/chain_bone3/cregion 0 1.757989

This weights point 0 to three regions (actually only two because the first entry has a weight of zero). Remember that the Override File is read after TouchDesigner does it's own capture weight computation, so in this case, if point 0 was originally assigned to region `/obj/chain_bone4/cregion 0`, this part of its weighting would be unchanged.
There is no upper limit to the number of regions that can be weighted to a point. If a point/region combination is in the file twice, the second one is used.

```
0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 1.0			
0 /obj/chain_bone1/cregion 0 2.0

This causes the first entry to be ignored (a weighting of 2.0 is used).

The weight field is used to prescribe the relative amount of influence a region has on a point. It can be any number. The range of the weights computed by TouchDesigner are specified by the Inner/Outer Weight parameter of each Capture Region (please see [Capture Region SOP](Capture_Region_SOP.html "Capture Region SOP")).
The easiest way to a capture Override File is to use the Save Override File button (see below) and start from the file produced by TouchDesigner.

## Parameters - Override Page

Save File `savefile` - The file specified here can be used as a "working file" to save the point weighting of all the points or a selected subset of points. The file format for the capture override files is fairly straight-forward (see above), so this is a good place to start if you need to do custom overriding.
Increment Save File `autoincr` - This increments the Save File name before saving. Be careful about turning this option off because there is no warning or confirm dialog to prevent you from overwriting an .ocapt file.
Save All Data to File `savecaptfile` - This saves the point weighting of all points to the Save File.
Save Selected Points to File `savesel` - This saves the point weighting only for the points that are selected in the viewport.

Note: you must be editing this particular SOP in the Viewport for this selection to apply to this SOP.

Extra Information for the Capture SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Carve SOP

The Carve SOP works with any face or surface type, be that polygon, Bzier, or NURBS. It can be used to slice a primitive, cut it into multiple sections, or extract points or cross-sections from it.

Like the Project SOP, it also creates profile curves, but they are extracted as iso-parametric (2D) profiles directly from a surface, whereas the Project SOP extracts a 3D curve projected onto a surface.

Note: When using a Carve SOP on a trimmed surface, you can't fillet or join the trim curves.

## Parameters - Carve Page

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the Group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in the Scripting Guide under Pattern Matching.
First U `firstu` - Enables the parameter to set the first position in U.
First U `domainu1` - This specifies a starting location to begin the cut/extract. Select this and a parametric U location between 0 and 1.
Second U `secondu` - Enables the parameter to set the second position in U.
Second U `domainu2` - This specifies an ending location to complete the cut / extract. Select this and a parametric U location between 0 and 1.
First V `firstv` - Enables the parameter to set the first position in V.
First V `domainv1` - This specifies a starting location to begin the cut/extract. Select this and a parametric V location between 0 and 1. Applies only to surfaces.
Second V `secondv` - Enables the parameter to set the second position in V.
Second V `domainv2` - This specifies an ending location to complete the cut / extract. Select this and a parametric V location between 0 and 1. Applies only to surfaces.

## Parameters - Method Page

Carve Method `method` - ⊞ - Select between Cut and Extract methods.

* Cut `cut` - Cut will slice (or 'cut-out') the original geometry within the area specified on the Carve Page.

* Extract `extract` - Extract will create 3D curves, points, or 2D profiles within the area specified on the Carve page. The Extract Type parameter is used to determine what is extracted.

Keep Inside `keepin` - Keep the primitives specified between the first and second locations.
Keep Outside `keepout` - Keep the primitives lying outside the first and second locations.
Extract Type `extractop` - ⊞ - If enabled, it will extract a cross-section along each location specified above.

Note: if a face is used, only points can be extracted and the V parameters have no effect.

* Extract 3D Isoparametric Curve(s) `xisoparm` - The extraction operation creates a 3-D, free-floating curve that matches the surface perfectly at the given U or V location.

* Extract Point(s) `xpoint` - Available for Mesh and surfaces only. If selected, it will create a point at every U, V location specified, rather than removing a U cross section and a V cross section.

* Extract 2D Isoparametric Profile(s) `xprofile` - Creates a 2D curve at the specified U/V location that matches the surface perfectly.

Keep Original `keeporiginal` - If selected, it will not remove the original primitive.
Location `location` - ⊞ - Determines how the Cut/Extract is defined at the boundaries. Additionally, extra subdivisions can be added in two ways using the parameters below.

* Divisions `div` - The Cut/Extract occurs precisely at the locations defined on the Carve page. Additional divisions can be specified using the U/V Divisions parameters below and they are evenly distributed across the Cut/Extracted geoemtry.

* Breakpoints `break` - Performs cutting or extractions at breakpoints for curves and surfaces, at vertices for polygons, and along isoparms for meshes.

By default this option will only cut the outer breakpoints within the specified interval. By selecting Breakpoints, the U and V Divisions parameters are replaced with Cut At All Internal U/V Breakpoints, which cut the primitives at all breakpoints falling within the specified interval when enabled.

U Divisions `divsu` - This specifies the number of cuts / extracts to be performed between first U and the second U.
V Divisions `divsv` - Specifies the number of cuts/extracts to be performed between first V and second V.
Cut at All Internal U Breakpoints `allubreakpoints` - When using Location = Breakpoints, the resulting primitive is divided at all U breakpoints into separate primitives.
Cut at All Internal V Breakpoints `allvbreakpoints` - When using Location = Breakpoints, the resulting primitive is divided at all V breakpoints into separate primitives.

### Opening a Closed Primitive

Given a closed surface, it can be converted to an identical open surface at any location by using the Carve SOP, and cutting at a single location (e.g. First U enabled, Second U disabled). The same is true for faces.

### Dicing a Face or Surface

Select the Cut operation, First U = `0`, Second U = `1`, First V = `0`, Second V = `1`, with (at least) three Divisions for U and V. This will dice the surface into (at least) 3 components. This can later be used with the Primitive SOP to "explode" the surface.

### Cutting a Hole in a Surface

Select the Cut operation, First U = `0.33`, Second U = `0.66`, First V = `0.33`, Second V = `0.66`, `2` Divisions for U and V. Keep Inside is off, Keep Outside is on. This will cut a rectangular region from the centre of the surface.

### Animating a Point Over a Face or Surface

Select the Extract option, First U = `x`, Last U disabled, First V = `y`, Last V disabled, Extract Point is on, Keep Primitives is optional. This will create a point over any position on the surface (0<=x<=1, 0<=y<=1).

Cell Class - Derivative

# Cell Class

The Cell Class describes the contents of a single cell from a [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") operator table.
The [DAT Class](DAT_Class.html "DAT Class") offers many ways of accessing its individual cells.
[DAT](DAT.html "DAT") cells are always internally stored as strings, but may be accessed as numeric values.

**IMPORTANT**: `op('table1')[1,2]` is this python cell object which usually gets converted for you to the string in the cell. More safely use `op('table1')[1,2].val` which always gives you the string.

> True if the referenced cell currently exists, False if it has been deleted.

`row` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> The numeric row of the cell.

`col` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> The numeric column of the cell.

`val` → `str` :

> Get or set the cell contents, which are always stored as a string value.

`run(*args, endFrame=False, fromOP=None, asParameter=False, group=None, delayFrames=0, delayMilliSeconds=0, delayRef=None)`→ `td.Run`:

> [Run](Run_Class.html "Run Class") the contents of the cell as a script, returning a Run object which can be used to optionally modify its execution.
> 
> * endFrame - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the execution will be delayed until the end of the current frame.
> * fromOP - (Keyword, Optional) Specifies an optional [operator](OP_Class.html "OP Class") from which the execution will be run relative to.
> * asParameter - (Keyword, Optional) When fromOP used, run relative to a parameter of fromOP.
> * group - (Keyword, Optional) Can be used to specify a group label string. This label can then be used with the [td.runs](Runs_Class.html "Runs Class") object to modify its execution.
> * delayFrames - (Keyword, Optional) Can be used to delay the execution a specific amount of frames.
> * delayMilliSeconds - (Keyword, Optional) Can be used to delay the execution a specific amount of milliseconds. This value is rounded to the nearest frame.
> * delayRef - (Keyword, Optional) Specifies an optional [operator](OP_Class.html "OP Class") from which the delay time is derived. If none is provided, will use the cell owner.
> * arg - (Optional) Arguments that will be made available to the script in a local tuple named args.

`offset(r, c)`→ `Cell | None`:

> The cell offset to this cell by the specified amount, or None.
> 
> * r - The number of rows from the cell. Positive values count down, while negative values count up.
> * c - The number of columns from the cell. Positive values count right, while negative values count left.
> 
> ```
> c = op('table1')['March', 'Sales']
> d = c.offset(-1, 2)  # one row up, two columns right of cell C
> 
> ```

### Casting to a Value[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Casting to a Value")]

The Cell Class implements all necessary methods to be treated as a number or a string, which in this case gets or sets its value. Therefore, an explicit call to get or set val is unnecessary when used in a parameter, or in an expression.
For example, the following are equivalent in a numeric parameter:

```
(float)n[1,2]
n[1,2].val
n[1,2]

Or equivalently, for a string parameter:

```
(str)n[1,2]
n[1,2].val
n[1,2]

Similarly, expressions on Cells will autocast themselves automatically:

```
n[1,2].val + 1 # string plus 1, error
n[1,2] + 1 # autocasted value plus 1

In the second case, the contents of the Cell are used to determine if numeric or string operations should be used.
For example, if cell n[1,2] contains "3" then:

```
n[1,2].val + n[1,2].val # will return "33" since .val is a string.

However,

```
n[1,2] + n[1,2] # will return 6 since the contents "3" are numeric.

If n[1,2] contained a non-numeric value such as "a" then

```
n[1,2] + n[1,2] # will return "aa"

Channel Class - Derivative

# Channel Class

A Channel object describes a single [channel](Channel.html "Channel") from a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). The [CHOP Class](CHOP_Class.html "CHOP Class") provides many ways of accessing its individual channels.
See [Working with CHOPs in Python](https://docs.derivative.ca/Working_with_CHOPs_in_Python "Working with CHOPs in Python") for more examples of how to use this class.

> True if the referenced chanel value currently exists, False if it has been deleted.

> The numeric index of the channel.

> The name of the channel.

`exports` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> The (possibly empty) list of [parameters](Par_Class.html "Par Class") this channel currently exports to.

`vals` → `list` :

> Get or set the full list of Channel values. Modifying Channel values can only be done in Python within a [Script CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/ScriptCHOP_Class "ScriptCHOP Class").

`[index]`→ `float`:

> Sample values may be easily accessed from a Channel using the [] subscript operator.
> 
> * index - Must be an numeric sample index. Wildcards are not supported.
> 
> To get the third sample from the channel, assuming the channel has 3 or more samples:
> 
> ```
> n = op('pattern1')
> c = n['chan1'][2] # the third sample
> l = len(n['chan2']) # the total number of samples in the channel
> 
> ```

`eval(index)`→ `float`:

> Evaluate the channel at the specified index sample index. If no index is given, the current index based on the current time is used.
> 
> * index - (Optional) The sample index to evaluate at.

`evalFrame(frame)`→ `float`:

> Evaluate the channel at the specified frame. If no frame is given, the current frame is used.
> 
> * frame - (Optional) The frame to evaluate at.

`evalSeconds(secs)`→ `float`:

> Evaluate the channel at the specified seconds. If no time is given, the current time is used.
> 
> * secs - (Optional) The time in seconds to evaluate at.

`numpyArray()`→ `numpy.ndarray`:

> Returns this channels data as a NumPy array with a length equal to the track length.

> Destroy and remove the actual Channel this object refers to. This operation is only valid when the channel belongs to a  [Script CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/ScriptCHOP_Class "ScriptCHOP Class") or [OSC In CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/OscinCHOP_Class "OscinCHOP Class") .
> Note: after this call, other existing Channel objects in this CHOP may no longer be valid.

`average()`→ `float`:

> Returns the average value of all the channel samples.

`min()`→ `float`:

> Returns the minimum value of all the channel samples.

`max()`→ `float`:

The Channel Class implements all necessary methods to be treated as a number, which in this case evaluates its current value. Therefore, an explicit call to eval() is unnecessary when used in a parameter, or in a numeric expression.

For example, the following are equivalent in a channel:

```
(float)n['chan1']
n['chan1'].eval()

The following are also equivalent, because the + 1 will implicitly cast the channel to a number:

```
n['chan1'].eval() + 1
n['chan1'] + 1

# Channel Mix TOP

The Channel Mix TOP allows mixing of the input RGBA channels to any other color channel of the output. For example, the pixels in the blue channel of the input can be added to the output's red channel, added or subtracted by the amount in Red parameter's blue column.

See also [Reorder TOP](Reorder_TOP.html "Reorder TOP").

## Parameters - Channel Mix Page

The parameters below are laid out in red, green, blue, and alpha columns. The first column, or first value of 4 for each parameter, represents the red input channel. The second is the green input channel, the third is blue, and the forth is alpha of the input.

The default settings in Channel Mix pass the image through unaltered. Notice that the **Red** parameter's red column is 1, so the red input channel is passing through to the red output. Change this to 0 and the output image will contain none of the red input channel. Set the Red parameter's blue column to 1, this will output any pixels in the blue channel of the input in the output's red channel.

These are floating point parameters. Using negative numbers will subtract values from the channel.

CHOP - Derivative

# CHOP

[![OP CHOP.png](images/e/e9/OP_CHOP.png)](File_OP_CHOP.html)

**CHOPs**, or **CHannel OPerators**, are a powerful technology which enables the processing of motion, audio, math, logic, MIDI data, numeric info and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

CHOPs are an [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))).

CHOPs provide a unique way of creating and editing motion and audio. The combination of procedural editing of motion, keyframe animation, motion capture and live controls provides you with a wide range of animation techniques. In keeping with the TouchDesigner procedural paradigm, channel operators combine and refine the data without destroying the original data. CHOPs were designed to reduce the tedium of motion editing and to help build and manage more complex motion. CHOPs enable creators to think about motion at a more creative level and to experiment with motion more than any other animation technology.

A CHOP contains one or more named **channels**. The channels of a CHOP is made of a sequence of one or more "**samples**". A sample is one floating point number per channel.

A CHOP has a **sample rate**, which is the number samples-per-second, which matters only when a CHOP represents animation or audio over time.

The length of a CHOP is expressed in samples, and when the CHOP represents animation or audio, the length can also be expressed in seconds or frames. A frame is a unit of time of the timeline, typically 1/60 of a second.

A CHOP creates or modifies the [Channel](Channel.html "Channel"), and then passes the channels on to the next CHOP in a network. CHOPs are then connected to object motion or any other animated part of TouchDesigner via "[exporting](Export.html "Export")" and "channel references".

## CHOPs Create and Process Channels[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: CHOPs Create and Process Channels")]

CHOPs are procedural networks, where "procedural" means the operators are wired together so the output of one CHOP flows into the input of one or more other CHOPs, and the data flows automatically every time the display is updated (by default, 60 times per second).

Some CHOPs, generator CHOPs, create CHOP channels from scratch. Some examples are the Constant CHOP, the Wave CHOP, and the Timing CHOP. CHOPs can also take data from

* on-screen sliders, buttons, menus, XY-controllers, XYZ values from clicking in 3D viewers.
* hardware devices including data via MIDI and OSC protocols.
* other processes/applications feeding TouchDesigner through pipes.

CHOPs process channel data and connect the results to any other part of TouchDesigner.

## Parts of a CHOP[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Parts of a CHOP")]

[![CHOP.1.png](images/thumb/e/e5/CHOP.1.png/800px-CHOP.1.png)](File_CHOP.1.html)

A CHOP contains a set of **Channels**, plus control **[Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Parameters&action=edit&redlink=1 "Parameters (page does not exist)")**, a **sample rate**, some on/off **[Flags](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Flags&action=edit&redlink=1 "Flags (page does not exist)")**, and a **start/end interval**.

The channels of a CHOP can represent motion, MIDI, audio, color maps, rolloff curves or lookup tables. Any data that can be represented as a sequence of numbers can be represent in CHOP channels. The sequence of numbers are called **samples**.

Like all [Operators](Operator.html "Operator"), CHOPs have **[Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Parameters&action=edit&redlink=1 "Parameters (page does not exist)")** used to define the data, plus the data channels, which are input/output from the CHOP as its data stream. The parameters are usually constant-valued, but can be time-dependent expressions.

CHOPs' parameters can be expressed in different CHOP **units**: samples (indexes), frames or seconds. These units are selected by the user in a menu to the right of such parameters. Each sample index, starting from 0, corresponds to some frame number (based on frames per second), and a moment in time (seconds).

[![CHOP Units menu](images/3/3d/CHOPUnits.jpg)](File_CHOPUnits.html "CHOP Units menu")

The **sample rate** (samples per second) is used if the CHOP contains time-dependent motion or audio data. Audio has a high sample rate when compared to animated motion.

Each CHOP has **flags**:

* The Display flag marks the CHOP to be displayed in a [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer").
* The Export flag causes the CHOP channel [exports](Export.html "Export") to toggle on and off.
* The Lock flag causes the CHOP to be locked and then can be hand-edited.
* The [Bypass Flag](Bypass_Flag.html "Bypass Flag") is a convenient way for a CHOP's effect to be disabled.

CHOPs can have any start/end indexes but all channels in a single CHOP share the same **start-end interval**. The interval goes from a start index to an end index and is not restricted to the length of any animation or timeline.

Each CHOP also has a **comment field** to add a note to a CHOP to explain what it is doing in the network. An **info pop-up** can be opened by middle-clicking on the CHOP, this lists channel names and values, sample rate and intervals.

In CHOPs, **Extend Conditions** determine what numbers you get when you try to get a channel value that is outside its start-end range - in its **Extend Regions**, before the CHOP's start time or after its end time. The CHOP may hold its last value, it may cycle, repeat, or be held at a default value. You can see a CHOP's extend conditions in the info pop-up (middle-mouse click on the CHOP), or by looking at a CHOP in the channel viewer outside its start-end range. You will see that a [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP") cycles and a [Keyframe CHOP](Keyframe_CHOP.html "Keyframe CHOP") holds in the Extend Regions.

You can change the Extend Conditions with an [Extend CHOP](Extend_CHOP.html "Extend CHOP") or via menus on the Channel page in many CHOPs.

See also [Anatomy of a CHOP](Anatomy_of_a_CHOP.html "Anatomy of a CHOP").

## Inputs and Outputs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Inputs and Outputs")]

Each CHOP receives channels at its inputs. When the CHOP [cooks](Cook.html "Cook"), the channels of the inputs are combined. The CHOP outputs the resulting channels to other CHOPs.

CHOPs output their data channels as arrays of numbers, not keyframed, interpolated segments. Some CHOPs ([Keyframe CHOP](Keyframe_CHOP.html "Keyframe CHOP")) retain interpolated segments internally, but all CHOPs always output their data as raw samples. If the CHOP's inputs are not changing and the control parameters are not time-dependent, the CHOP will be non-time-dependent and it will not cook every time the animation frame on the timeline advances.

Some CHOPs output or use CHOP **attributes**, such as channels grouped as quaternion rotation channels.

## Referencing and Exporting CHOP Channels[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Referencing and Exporting CHOP Channels")]

*Main article: [Export](Export.html "Export")*

Parameters of any node are able to get values from CHOP channels with expressions like the following:

```
op('filter1')[0]
op('filter1')['chan2']
op('pattern1')['chan1'][99]    # gets the 100th sample of chan1

CHOP data channels are exported to Components, SOPs, etc. to drive their parameters. CHOPs can be exported to any TouchDesigner operator's parameter. Each CHOP has an Export flag (and an Export Prefix, infrequently used), causing the CHOP to connect its channels to Components, SOPs, TOPs and so on. The Export flag and Export Prefix can also use automatic matching of channels names to find export destinations. For example, a CHOP "tx" channel could map to an Geometry Component's tx parameter. When a CHOP exports to an object, SOP or TOP, the parameters exported to are said to be overridden.

## Difference Between a Sample and a Frame[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Difference Between a Sample and a Frame")]

A frame always refers to the timeline, which is expressed in frames or seconds, and frames & seconds are tied via a certain number of "frames per second" or FPS. The default FPS for TouchDesigner is 60, and with FPS of 60, there will always be 60 frames per second. A CHOP range can start at any frame number (or second), and end at any later frame number. A frame will always correspond to a certain time expressed in seconds. Precisely, seconds is `(frame-1)/FPS`.

The sample index may have no relation to time or frame, as when a CHOP is used as lookup table. But when "index" is tied to time, the CHOP's samples per second (sample rate), determines how many samples per second there are, and even how many samples per frame. Some CHOPs default to 60 samples per second, which is 1 sample per frame. But CHOPs can be created or resampled to any sample rate, so a CHOP's sample rate of 240 samples per second gives 4 samples per frame, and audio at 24,000 samples per second is 400 samples per frame.

Even if a CHOP is shifted in time to start at a frame number like 301 (10 seconds), its sample index always starts at 0. Its `op('wave1').sampleIndex` is 0 at its first sample.

**NOTE**: Set the "frames per second" of the timeline for the project via the bottom of the timeline, or in Python `project.cookRate = 120`, for example. It is better to DO IT AT THE START OF A PROJECT, lest you get tripped up. Note each component can have its own timeline and its own sample rate. See [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline").

## Sample Index and Value[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sample Index and Value")]

* The horizontal axis is called the i-axis or the sample index-axis.
* The vertical axis is called the v-axis or the value-axis.
* A sample index is a point along the i-axis, denoted by i.
* A value is a point along the v-axis, denoted by v.
* A sample is an index-value pair (i,v). i.e. the value of a channel at a certain sample index.
* A sample is made of a sample index and a sample value.
* An interval is an index range, which goes from a start index to an end index.
* A value range goes from a start value to an end value.
* The index duration is the end index minus the start index + 1.
* CHOP data channels are arrays of raw samples, in 32-bit floating point format, all computations are done at 64 bits, and parameters are stored as 64 bits.
* Channels in a CHOP may be control (parameter) channels or data channels. CHOPs manipulate the data channels.
* CHOPs can be evaluated at integer and non-integer indexes.
* Frame is used when the index corresponds to time.
* When speaking of animation frames, you can refer to start frame, end frame and frame range.

## Using `.chanIndex` in CHOP Parameters[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Using .chanIndex in CHOP Parameters")]

A "Channel Index" is the channel number of a CHOP, 0 being the first channel, and is available for use in parameters in some CHOPs as `me.chanIndex`. Numerous CHOPs like the [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP"), [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") and [Delay CHOP](Delay_CHOP.html "Delay CHOP") have extra local members that allow the customization of each channel: The Python object for the operator has a `.chanIndex` member. For example, if the Pattern CHOP generates three channels you can put something like `[3, 4, 5][me.chanIndex]` in the Amplitude parameter to customize its value for each channel. The first channel will be evaluated with an Amplitude value 3, the second channel with a value of 5, etc. Search `me.chanIndex` in the wiki. See also the Scope parameter on most CHOPs to affect selective channels.

## Common CHOP Members[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Common CHOP Members")]

There are Python members of a CHOP that are common to many or all CHOPs. See [CHOP Class](CHOP_Class.html "CHOP Class") and [Channel Class](Channel_Class.html "Channel Class").

## Channel Name Creation[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Channel_Page&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Channel Name Creation")]

Channel Name - The following kinds of text patterns generate multiple channel names:

| Channel Pattern | Channels Created |
| --- | --- |
| `chan1 chan2 chan3` | `chan1 chan2 chan3` |
| `chan[1-3]` | `chan1 chan2 chan3` |
| `ch[1-2]n[2-6:2]` | `ch1n2 ch1n4 ch1n6 ch2n2 ch2n4 ch2n6` |
| `r[xyz]` | `rx, ry rz` |
| `geo[1-2]:t[xy]` | `geo1:tx geo1:ty geo2:tx geo2:ty` |
| `gain band[4-6] off[lr]` | `gain band4 band5 band6 offl offr` |

## Start-End[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Channel_Page&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Start-End")]

Start/End - Specifies a start-end interval. The default is start-end of 0. The values in these options can be expressed in any [Units](CHOP_Common_Page.html#Units "CHOP Common Page").

## Sample Rate[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Channel_Page&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Sample Rate")]

Sample Rate - Usually the CHOP sample rate is set to 60 "samples per second". This means TouchDesigner will attempt to cook the operation 60 times per second. Using a lower sample rate than the global sample sample rate can cause aliasing (errors) in the channel data.

## Extend Conditions[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Channel_Page&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Extend Conditions")]

Extend Conditions - Found in the Extend CHOP and also in several generator CHOPs, this determines what values you get when you try to sample a CHOP outside its start-end range. It can hold values, repeat the channel and more.

When using the `chop()` function to sample a channel, the index-value may be outside the interval of the CHOP. But a reasonable value is returned. The user is able to control the value of the channel outside the CHOP's interval.

You can see the state of the Extend Conditions in the pop-up info of any CHOP.

Extend Left - The extend condition before the CHOP interval. They are:

* Hold - Hold the first or last value.
* Slope - Continue the slope before the start, or after the end of the channel.
* Cycle - Cycle the channel repeatedly.
* Mirror - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.
* Default Value - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

Extend Right - Extend condition after the interval. Same options as Extend Left.

Default Value - The value used for the Default Value extend condition.

## Legal Channel Names[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Channel_Page&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Legal Channel Names")]

CHOP channel names can have the following characters:

* Upper and lower-case letters
* Numbers
* The following characters: `-` `_` `:` `/`

In general, CHOPs will replace invalid characters with underscores.

CHOP Common Page - Derivative

# CHOP Common Page

Time Slice - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

Scope - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

Patterns can be used in the Scope: `*` (match all channels and therefore affect all channels), `?` (match single character. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Sample Rate Match - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When the CHOP needs to combine inputs with different sample rates, the Sample Rate Match Options offers these choices:

* Resample At First Input's Rate - Use rate of first input to resample others.
* Resample At Maximum Rate - Resample to the highest sample rate.
* Resample At Minimum Rate - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
* Error if Rates Differ - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the [Interpolation Method Option](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Frequent_CHOP_Parameters&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frequent CHOP Parameters (page does not exist)"), or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

Export Method - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.

* DAT Table by Index - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
* DAT Table by Name - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
* Channel Name is Path:Parameter - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

Export Root - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.

Export Table - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

# CHOP Execute DAT

The CHOP Execute DAT will run its script when the channel values of a specified CHOP change. You can specify which channels to look at, and trigger based on their values changing in various ways. The script gets called for every sample that changes, so when rendering one frame, it may get called 2 or more times per channel, depending on how many frames forward TouchDesigner has stepped (see [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")).

CHOP Execute DATs are created with [default python method placeholders](https://docs.derivative.ca/ChopexecuteDAT_Class "ChopexecuteDAT Class"). For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

Execute from `executeloc` - ⊞ - ([Tscript](Operator_Language.html "Operator Language") only) Determines the location the script is run from.

* Current Node `current` - ([Tscript](Operator_Language.html "Operator Language") only) The script is executed from the current node location.

* This Node `here` - The script is executed from the parent of the DAT. The DAT executes from the parent to make siblings of the DAT easy to access: DAT scripts used to execute from inside the DAT.

* Specified Operator `op` - The script is executed from the component specified in the Component parameter below.

From Operator `fromop` - The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to *Specified Operator*.
CHOP `chop` - The CHOP whose channel change will trigger the DAT to execute its script.
Channel `channel` - Which channel will trigger change.
Off to On `offtoon` - The onOffToOn() method executes when the channel specified switches from off to on, called at the first "on" frame.
While On `whileon` - The whileOn() method executes when the channel specified is on. It is called once each frame.
On to Off `ontooff` - The onOnToOff() method executes when the channel specified switches from on to off, called at the first "off" frame.
While Off `whileoff` - The whileOff() method executes when the channel specified is off. It is called once each frame.
Value Change `valuechange` - The onValueChange() method executes when the channel specified changes value in any way. It is called once each frame.
While Off/On Frequency `freq` - ⊞ - Enabled when using the While On or While Off options above. Determines if the DAT executes For Every Sample or Once Per Frame.

* Execute For Every Sample `everysample` -

* Execute Once Per Frame `onceperframe` -

## Parameters - File Page

File `file` - The filesystem path and name of the file to load. Accepts `.txt` and `.dat` files.
Sync to File `syncfile` - When On, loads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts. A filename must be specified. Turning on the option will load the file from disk immediately. If the file does not exist, it will be created the first time the DAT is updated. The file is monitored so that any changes made to the file will update the DAT, and any changes made to the DAT will be written to the file right away. If the file is removed, the DAT will retain its current contents.
Load on Start `loadonstart` - When On, reloads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts.
Load File `loadonstartpulse` - Instantly reloads the file.
Write on Toe Save `write` - When On, writes the contents of the DAT out to the file on disk when the project is saved.

CHOP Export - Derivative

# CHOP Export

CHOP exporting sends the number values in a CHOP channel to a [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter") of any operator.

There are numerous ways to export CHOP channels in TouchDesigner.

**TIP:** it is better to export from a [Null CHOP](Null_CHOP.html "Null CHOP") so you can add various CHOPs inline to the network without the need to re-export from another CHOP.

For exporting from DATs, see also: [DAT Export](DAT_Export.html "DAT Export").

## How to Export Channels from CHOPs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: How to Export Channels from CHOPs")]

### Exporting from a CHOP Viewer[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Exporting from a CHOP Viewer")]

1. Make sure you have the parameter you want to export to visible somewhere on your interface. For example, select the OP and display its parameters by pressing 'p' hotkey, or open a floating parameter dialog for that OP.
2. Turn on the [Viewer Active Flag](Viewer_Active_Flag.html "Viewer Active Flag") of the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer") for the CHOP you wish to export from, if it is not already on.
3. Drag a channel from the viewer to the parameter. When dropped, select **Export CHOP** from the pop-up menu. Note the parameter goes green indicating it's being exported-to.

**TIP:** You can quickly get to the parameters you need by momentarily hovering the dragged channel over the target OP, this will bring up that OP's parameter page. From there you can hover the dragged channel over any of its parameter tabs to switch to that tab of parameters, then drop onto your desired parameter.

### Using Export by Channel Name[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Using Export by Channel Name")]

You can setup export by channel name by selecting **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** in the **Export Method** parameter on the Common page of any CHOP.
CHOP channels will automatically be exported if the channel name can resolve to the path:parameter in the file. '`:`' and/or '`/`' are used as separators for the paths and parameter. For example a channel named `geo1:tx`, will get exported to a node named `geo1`, parameter `tx`, if it exists. The node is searched for starting at the node that the **Export Root** parameter refers to. Usually the Export Root is left as default, which is '`parent()`' in python. This means "start searching at my parent". So for the above example, the CHOP will need to be in the same network as `geo1` for the export to work. The channel names can contain paths, such as `container1/geo1:tx`. which will search for `container1/geo1` (relative to the Export Root), parameter `tx`. You can use `/` and `:` in the channel names interchangeably for this feature, however a good convention to follow is use `name1/name2` for the path to the node, followed by a `:` to separate the node from the parameter name.

**Note:** In a CHOP using Export by Name, all channels export if they can resolve to a parameter. You can not individually disconnect channels from this method of exporting, its all channels or none. To remove a channel that is exporting, you need to select/delete/remove that channel from the input so it is no longer reaching the exporting CHOP.

## How to Confirm Exporting[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: How to Confirm Exporting")]

### From the Parameter[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: From the Parameter")]

A parameter that is exported-to will be highlighted in green. Clicking on the parameter name to display the parameter’s expression will display the path to the CHOP channel that is overriding the parameter. Alternatively you can right-click on the parameter's name and the pop-up menu will display an option to **Jump to Export CHOP**. Selecting this will take you directly to the CHOP the data is exported from.

### From the CHOP[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: From the CHOP")]

If you go back and inspect the CHOP that the channel originates from, you will notice that the [Export Flag](Export_Flag.html "Export Flag") is now on. You can toggle this flag on/off to activate/deactivate the export from this CHOP.

You can also quickly check if the a channel is exporting by holding down middle mouse button on a CHOP and inspecting the pop-up help info. The path reported to the right of the channel’s values is the path the channel exports to. This is convenient for a quick check, but it will not display multiple paths if the channel exports to multiple parameters (The first parameter’s path will be followed by ... if there are other parameter export paths).

## Discovering Where the Channel Comes From[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Discovering Where the Channel Comes From")]

### What if you forget where the parameter’s overriding channel is coming from?[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: What if you forget where the parameter’s overriding channel is coming from?")]

Simply hold right mouse button down over the overridden parameter. When the pop-up menu appears, the last entry will be **Jump to Export CHOP** /CHOP’s path. You can then navigate your networks to this node, or selecting this menu option will take you directly to the node that is exporting the channel.

## Removing an Export Connection[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Removing an Export Connection")]

### Disabling a CHOP’s Exports[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Disabling a CHOP’s Exports")]

1. To disable all the exporting channels coming out of a CHOP, simply turn off that CHOP’s Export flag.
2. Disabling the Export flag will stop all channels from exporting from this CHOP.
3. Change the [Parameter Mode](Parameter_Mode.html "Parameter Mode") from Export to Constant or Expression.

### Removing a Single Export[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Removing a Single Export")]

1. On the parameter being exported to, right-click and select **Remove Export**. NOTE: That will only remove the export from one channel from the exporting CHOP, and this is not possible when using the Export Method **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** described above.

## Tips[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Tips")]

### Exporting from Null CHOPs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Exporting from Null CHOPs")]

It is good practice to always export channels from a [Null CHOP](Null_CHOP.html "Null CHOP") appended to the end of your network.

The reason for this is simple. If you export from the last node in your network, but decide later that you need to filter the data further, you would have to append the new filter CHOP and then redo all your export connections form this new node. Using a Null CHOP at the end of your network as an exporting place holder, you can always insert another node into the network directly before the Null. This will keep all your export connections intact.

It is also helpful to rename your Null CHOP to reflect the destination, like *toGearSpeed*.

### Exporting to Toggles and Menus[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Exporting to Toggles and Menus")]

Toggle checkboxes and parameter menus can be exported to as well. Drag & Drop the channel over the checkbox or menu, then select **Export CHOP** from the pop-up menu.

For toggle checkboxes, values 0 and less are 'off' and values greater than 0 are 'on'. For parameter menus, the first menu entry is selected when the CHOP channel value is 0, the second is selected when the value is 1, the third when the value is 2, and so on.

### Using Expressions in Parameters[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Export&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Using Expressions in Parameters")]

CHOP Exporting is normally set up from the CHOP channel to the parameter by drag & dropping the channel to the parameter. Alternatively, parameters can reference a CHOP channel using an expression in the parameter. This is a more parameter-centric approach, and the same expression can be used in multiple parameters. In python, use an expression like `op('wave1')['chan1']` to get a CHOP channel's value.

For example, for the CHOP `/project1/stimulate/math6` and channel `vidproc_motion`, the following Python expression could be used:

`op('/project1/stimulate/math6')['vidproc_motion']`

A text string that contains data (string, float, list, boolean, etc.) and operators (+ \* < etc) that are evaluated by the node's language (python or Tscript) and returns a string, float list or boolean, etc. Expressions are used in parameters, [DATs](DAT.html "DAT") and in scripts.

## Getting RGBA values between TOPs and CHOPs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Getting RGBA values between TOPs and CHOPs")]

The [TOP to CHOP](TOP_to_CHOP.html "TOP to CHOP") is used to get the RGBA values in a [TOP](TOP.html "TOP")'s pixels into the channels of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"), where they can be edited with CHOPs.

The [CHOP to TOP](CHOP_to_TOP.html "CHOP to TOP") gets pixel values quickly back into TOPs.

## Getting XYZ values between SOPs and CHOPs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Getting XYZ values between SOPs and CHOPs")]

The [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") is used to get the XYZ values in a [SOP](SOP.html "SOP")'s points into the channels of a CHOP, where they can be edited with CHOPs. All point attributes in a SOP can be obtained, including user-defined point attributes.

The [CHOP to SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP") is used to get values in CHOP channels into the points of a SOP. The CHOP to SOP takes a geometry at its input, and without changing the surface type or connections between vertices of polygons or meshes, it modifies point values only. It operates much more quickly than the Point SOP.

Any point attribute can be replaced by values in CHOP channels.

In both cases, point groups in SOPs can be used to restrict the data being transferred between SOPs and CHOPs.

## Speeding Up CHOPs using the Performance Monitor[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Speeding Up CHOPs using the Performance Monitor")]

See [Optimize](Optimize.html "Optimize").

## Diagnosing CHOPs with the print() Function[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Diagnosing CHOPs with the print() Function")]

Sometimes it unclear what value a CHOP parameter may have when it is cooked, if it is an expression. You can put the expression in a print() function, and it will display its value when it evaluates. The syntax is `print(string, expression)` where string is printed in front of the value on the standard output.

## Multiple Objects and CHOP Networks[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Multiple Objects and CHOP Networks")]

Sometimes you want one CHOP network to drive one object. You may want to clone the pair dozens of times, but you may want each to behave a bit differently. So you want to get a number in each of the objects and CHOP networks that identifies it.

If you could get the digits in the object name and the CHOP network name, you could use this number to identify the unit. But there is no obvious way of getting that number into CHOP or object parameters. Here is a way:

The expression function, `opdigits()` gets the numbers that are in an OP name. For example, it extracts the 23 from an OP named leg23left .

This allows you to make one CHOP network for each of 100 similar characters. For example, in a CHOP, you can get the number of the CHOP network by using these functions:

```
   opname("..") = "ch1" (a string)

```
```
   opdigits("..") = 1 (a set of digits)

```
```
   opdigits("opname") returns the numeric value of the concatenation of all the digits in a node's name. It is used when building several similar networks. For example:
   opdigits("/obj/geo7") = 7

```
```
   opdigits("..") = 7 (at the SOP level of geo1)

In the 100 objects geo1 to geo100, you can use the expression:

```
   opdigits(".")

You can use this function in the Random Seed parameter in the [Noise CHOP](Noise_CHOP.html "Noise CHOP"), which will generate a different noise curve for each CHOP network.

## The Use of CHOPs in Managing Large Projects[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: The Use of CHOPs in Managing Large Projects")]

You can hold many moves for many characters in one CHOP network and examine any CHOP by connecting it to a character immediately. So it acts as a library and viewer of moves. Also, when several animators work on one project and the goal is to make the character have similar behavior from scene to scene, animators can pick moves from the library to start with. This is like a library of materials that keep the rendered look the same from scene to scene.

## Bypassing CHOP networks[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=CHOP_Techniques&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Bypassing CHOP networks")]

CHOP to SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# CHOP to SOP

The CHOP to SOP takes CHOP channels and generates 3D polygons in a SOP. It reads sample data from a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") and converts it into point positions and point attributes. This makes it complementary to the [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP"). The Channels created by the [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") can be modified and then re-inserted into the SOP network via a CHOP to SOP.

By default, the SOP is a line from (`-1 0 0`) to (`1 0 0`) containing one point for every sample in the CHOP.

It matches the input channels to the Channel Scope (`tx ty tz`) where possible. If `tx` or `ty` or `tz` don’t match anything, it just uses the value from the default line, and it only shows a Warning.

The simplest thing to do is to send it a channel named `ty`, which will make a 3D curve that looks like the CHOP curve.

This does what a [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP") with a `op('wave1')['chan1'].eval(0)` function can do, but is much faster.

By using point groups from the incoming SOP, the channels can be inserted only into the group's points.

The CHOP to SOP also supports custom attributes. If the user maps a channel to an attribute that is not found, that attribute is added to the points. Currently, all custom attributes are floats and of size = 1.

In its default state it will attempt to replace the point positions (`P(0) P(1) P(2)`) with the channels named `tx ty` and `tz`.

The channel and attribute scope are first expanded into individual names and matched on a 1 to 1 basis. If you are filling P it doesn't matter if you specify `t[xyz]` or `tx ty tz`, both will replace `P(0) P(1) P(2)`, which can be collapsed to `P`.

For example: Add custom attributes "Scale", "Twist" or "Roll" to the backbone's points with a CHOP to SOP.

If you connect a SOP to its input, it will use the SOP as a starting geometry versus the default line.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[choptoSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ChoptoSOP_Class "ChoptoSOP Class")

Group `group` - Modify only the points within this point group. If blank, all points are modified. Accepts patterns, as described in: [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
CHOP `chop` - Specifies which CHOP Network / CHOP contains the sample data to fetch.
Start Position `startpos` - ⊞ - Sets the bounds for positions that are not defined by a channel, ie. a channel is not set to one of the P attributes.

# CHOP to TOP

The CHOP to TOP puts CHOP channels into a TOP image. By default the texture created will be 32-bit floating point to match the precision of the CHOP data. This can be changed setting the TOP's Pixel Format to something other than 'Input'.

The Data Format parameter determines how the input channels are converted into pixel colors in the output image. For example, when the Data Format is set to 'R', each channel will be interpreted as a row of red pixel data. Likewise, if the Data Format is RGBA, then the first 4 channels will become a set of red, blue, green and alpha data for one row of pixels and each subsequent set of 4 channels will become additional rows. *Note:* Channels are grouped by their order in the CHOP rather than their names i.e. just because a channel is named g0 or b1 does not mean it will necessarily be be placed in a blue or green pixel.

The Image Layout parameter controls how the pixel rows are arranged in the output image. By default, the width of the image will be equal to the number of samples in the CHOP, clamped to a maximum texture width (often 32768) (the sample rate is ignored), and the height will be equal to the number of channel sets. For example, when the Data Format is RGB and the there are 9 input channels (for example, r0 g0 b0 r1 g1 b1 r2 g2 b2), there will be 3 rows of pixels using the default image layout.

If the channel length is longer than the image width, the wrapped layout option can be used to continue the channel data onto additional rows of pixels. Each new set of channels will still begin on a new row of pixels.

If the Image Layout parameter is set to Fit to Square, the TOP determines the image resolution based on the total number of samples across all channel sets (approximately the square root of the number of samples + 1) in width and height. This layout is most often used for point cloud data, where an efficient layout is preferred and the position of a pixel is not generally important. Unlike in the wrapped layout, channel sets in this mode are appended immediately to the end of the previous set, so that any empty pixels will appear at the end of the image. Where there are some unused pixels, you can fill the unused pixels at the top with a special value based on the Extra Pixel Values parameter, (0, 0, 0, 0) by default. To put (0, 0, 0, -1) you have to set the pixel format to 32-bit float so you can represent negative and positive numbers of any value.

## Parameters - CHOP to TOP Page

CHOP `chop` - The path of the CHOP being referenced.
Data Format `dataformat` - ⊞ - Determines how the input CHOP channels will be turned into an image. If the CHOP is missing channels required to provide all the data for a scanline, the extra channels are ignored.

* R `r` - Each channel is treated as the Red channel for a new scanline. Using the default Image Layout, the height of the image will be equal to the number of channels in the CHOP.

* RG `rg` - The first two channels will be the Red and Green channels for a scanline, the next two channels will be Red and Green for the next scanline, etc. Using the default Image Layout, the height of the image will be half the number of channels in the CHOP, rounded down.

* RGB `rgb` - The first three channels will be the Red, Green and Blue channels for a scanline, the next three channels will be Red, Green and Blue for the next scanline, etc. Using the default Image Layout, the height of the image will be the number of channels in the CHOP divided by 3, rounded down.

* RGBA `rgba` - The first four channels will be the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha channels for a scanline, the next four channels will be Red, Green, Blue and Alpha for the next scanline, etc. Using the default Image Layout, the height of the image will be the number of channels in the CHOP divided by 4, rounded down.

* A `a` - Each channel is treated as the Alpha channel for a new scanline. Using the default Image Layout, the height of the image will be equal to the number of channels in the CHOP.

* Legacy `legacy` - This mode only creates a single scanline in all cases. More than 4 channels will not do anything. If the CHOP has 1 or 2 channels, it will set R,G,B,A to the first channel of the CHOP. The 2nd channel is ignored. If it has 3 channels, it sets the 3 channels to R,G,B and A = sample number / # of samples (i.e A is a ramp starting at 0 and climbing to the (width -1). If it has 4 channels, they are set to R,G,B,A.

Clamp CHOP Values `clamp` - Clamps CHOP values to 0-1 range.
Image Layout `layout` - ⊞ - Controls the dimensions of the output image and how the CHOP samples are arranged as pixels. This menu replaces the previous 'Crop Long Channels' and 'Fit to Square' parameters.

* Row per Channel Set (Cropped) `rowscropped` - Each set of channels, as determined by the Data Format, is converted into a row of pixels in the output image. If the channel length exceeds the maximum texture resolution, or the custom width defined in the Output Resolution, the remaining samples are **ignored**. This option is equivalent to turning on the previous Crop Long Channels parameter.

* Row(s) per Channel Set (Wrapped) `rowswrapped` - Each set of channels, as determined by the Data Format, is converted into a row of pixels in the output image. If the channel length exceeds the maximum texture resolution, or the custom width defined in the Output Resolution, the remaining samples will be put **into a new row of pixels**. Additional channel sets will begin in a new row of the output rather than at the end of the previous set. This option is equivalent to turning off the previous Crop Long Channels parameter.

* Fit to Square (Combine Sets) `square` - Pixels are arranged in the smallest square texture that fits all of the given CHOP samples. Channel sets, as determined by the Data Format, are wrapped onto the next row of pixels if the CHOP channel length exceeds the width of the texture. Unlike the wrapped layout, the next channel set will begin at the next available pixel rather than starting in a new row. This option is equivalent to turning off the old 'Crop Long Channels' parameter and turning on the previous 'Fit to Square' parameter. This layout is most often used for point cloud data, where the position of a pixel in the image is not generally important.

Extra Pixel Values (RGBA) `rgba` - ⊞ - If the current Image Layout results in more pixels than there are available samples in the input CHOP, the values specified here will be used to fill in the extra pixels. (All textures require full rows of pixels, in other words all rows of pixels have the same number of pixels.)

* Red `rgba1` -

* Green `rgba2` -

* Blue `rgba3` -

* Alpha `rgba4` -

CHOP Viewer - Derivative

# CHOP Viewer

The CHOP Viewer is a 2D graph used to preview and edit CHOP channels. Any pane in TouchDesigner can be set to CHOP Viewer (shortcut alt+5).

The path for the CHOP viewer can be set to a particular CHOP or a network. The [Display Flag](Display_Flag.html "Display Flag") of the CHOP(s) must be turned on to view the channels in the CHOP viewer. When set to a network (ie no specific CHOP), the viewer can display channel from multiple CHOPs. The viewer can be divided into multiple graphs in 3 modes, Graph Per Single Channel, Graph Per CHOP, or Graph Per Channel Name.

Chroma Key TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Chroma Key TOP

The Chroma Key TOP pulls a key matte from the image using Hue, Saturation, and Value settings. If a pixel falls between the Min and Max parameters for all three settings, then it is included in the key. It outputs an alpha map, or the image with the key color removed.

See also the `chromaKey` component in the [Palette](Palette.html "Palette"), which is a user interface around the Chroma Key TOP that lets you grab frames on-the-fly and interactively set the key color ranges. The UI also adds edge softening and color spill controls.

Circle SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Circle SOP

The Circle SOP creates open or closed arcs, circles and ellipses.

If two NURBS circles that are non-rational (i.e. their X and Y radii are unequal) are skinned, more isoparms may be generated than expected. This is because non-rational NURBS circles parameterise their knots based on chord length, and the Skin SOP must consolidate the total number of knots between the two circles before skinning.

To remedy this, you may want to use a Refine SOP, and unrefine the resulting skin, or better yet - before unrefining, start with the same circle and use a Primitive or Transform SOP to deform the second copy before skinning.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[circleSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/CircleSOP_Class "CircleSOP Class")

Primitive Type `type` - ⊞ - For information on the different types, see the [Primitive](Primitive.html "Primitive") and [Spline](Spline.html "Spline") articles.

* Primitive `prim` -

* Polygon `poly` -

* NURBS Curve `nurbs` -

* Bezier Curve `bezier` -

Orientation `orient` - ⊞ - The plane on which the circle lies.

* YZ Plane `yz` -

* ZX Plane `zx` -

Modify Bounds `modifybounds` - Available only when an input is connected to the Curcle SOP to set bounds for the sphere. When Modify Bounds = On the transform parameters below will further modify the radius and position of the bounds.
Radius `rad` - ⊞ - The Radius of the Circle in the X and Y directions.

* X `radx` -

* Y `rady` -

Center `t` - ⊞ - The Center of the Circle in X, Y and Z.

Reverse Anchors `reverseanchors` - Invert the direction of anchors.
Anchor U `anchoru` - Set the point in X about which the geometry is positioned, scaled and rotated.
Anchor V `anchorv` - Set the point in Y about which the geometry is positioned, scaled and rotated.
Order `order` - If a spline curve is selected, it is built at this order.
Divisions `divs` - The number of edges (points +1) used to describe the circle. This option applies to polygons and imperfect splines. The more Divisions a circle has, the smoother it looks. Using three divisions makes a triangle, four divisions a diamond, five divisions a pentagon, and so on. Also, for open arc types, the number of points will equal Divisions + 1, and for closed arc types, Divisions + 2.
Arc Type `arc` - ⊞ - Determines how the circle should be drawn. Applies to polygons and imperfect splines only.

* Closed `closed` - An enclosed curve.

* `endangle` -

Imperfect `imperfect` - This option applies only to Bezier and NURBS circles. If selected, the circles are approximated non-rational curves, otherwise they are perfect rational closed curves.
Texture Coordinates `texture` - ⊞ - Option to include texture cooordinates or not.

* Off `off` - No texture coordinates are created.

* Face `face` - Default texture coordinates are created. To modify texture coordinates, see [Texture SOP](Texture_SOP.html "Texture SOP").

Circle TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Circle TOP

The Circle TOP can be used to generate circles, ellipses and N-sided polygons.

The shapes can be customized with different sizes, rotation and positioning. An optional border can be added to the shape. Background, border and fill colors can all be set independently. Anti-aliasing can be turned on or off.

You can use the arc angles to cut out part of the shape. In the case of polygons, the number of visible sides will be preserved no matter how much is cut out.

Clay SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Clay SOP

The Clay SOP deforms faces and surfaces by pulling points that lie directly on them. As opposed to the Point SOP or other SOPs that manipulate control points (CVs), the Clay SOP operates on the primitive contours themselves, providing a direct, intuitive, and unconstrained way of reshaping geometry. Thus, rather than translating CVs to change the aspect of the primitive, the Clay SOP takes the inverse approach of manipulating the primitive's skin to reposition the CVs.

The point that defines the area to be modified is called a "target point" or "target" for short. It is expressed as a (u,v) pair in the parametric space of the primitive and ranges between 0 and 1 in both U and V. The image of the target point on the primitive is a 3D point which Clay can displace in several ways. Furthermore, if the primitive is a surface, there is are options to pull only the point or a whole isoparametric curve in either U or V.

Clay does not refine the faces and surfaces unless asked to, so the complexity of the geometry does not increase. The area affected by the change varies with each primitive type and topology. In all cases it is possible to reduce to amount of change by inserting a Refine SOP before the Clay SOP and inserting detail around the target point. For other ways to increase the locality of the deformation as well as its sharpness, see U and V Sharpness below.

If a second input is present, it is possible to snap the target (u,v) point to an (s,t) point on the first primitive of the second input. Without a second input, the primitives can be made to snap to themselves. Moreover, the Clay SOP is able to snap the target to arbitrary points in space.

Both this SOP and the Align SOP can be used effectively as snapping tools and building blocks for curve networks. The main difference between the two SOPs is that Clay deforms the inputs partially, while Align translates and/or rotates the whole primitive.

The Clay SOP accepts a mix of any combination of face and surface types.

## Parameters - Clay Page

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching in the [Scripting Guide].
Warp Method `method` - ⊞ - The following describe the four types of transformations the Clay SOP can apply to the target (U, V) points or isoparametric curves (U or V). All the transformations are exclusive, and all reduce to a signed translation along a direction. The difference between the various transformations is the way the translation and the direction are specified.

* Matrix `mat` - The matrix method relocates the target point based on a transformation matrix. For a description of transforms, see the [Transform SOP](Transform_SOP.html "Transform SOP").

* Vector `vec` - The vector method provides a distance and a vector to translate along.

* Point `point` - The point method provides a 3D point in object space that the target point must snap to.

* Primitive `prim` - The primitive method allows the target point to be snapped to a point on another primitive. Any primitive type is allowed, including metaballs, all quadrics, and even particle systems. The point on the destination primitive is expressed parametrically as a (U, V) pair.

If the Clay SOP has a second input, then the destination primitive is going to be the first primitive in that input. If there is no second input, the primitives in the first input will snap to themselves (each face or surface to itself).

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Sets the overall transform order for the transformations. The transform order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results using the exact same values. Choose the appropriate order from the menu.

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - Sets the order of the rotations within the overall transform order.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These three fields move the Source geometry in the three axes.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - These three fields rotate the Source geometry in the three axes.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - These three fields scale the Source geometry in the three axes.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The pivot point for the transformations (not the same as the pivot point in the pivot channels). The pivot point parameters allow you to define the point about which geometry scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the object.

For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of an object is located at: `-1, -1, 0` and you wanted to scale the object by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%) the object would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.

[![TouchGeometry91.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/b/bf/TouchGeometry91.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry91.gif)

In the example above, rotations performed on an object with different pivot points produce very different results.

Distance `dist` - Specifies the translation distance along the given vector.
Normal `normal` - When On, the translation will be performed along the primitive normal at the target (U, V) point. Otherwise an explicit direction is required, see Direction parameter below. If the input contains face primitives, the primitive normal is independent of the target (U) point. Primitive normals can be displayed from the Display Options dialog.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - The direction of the vector is the Normal parameter above is Off.

* X `dirx` -

* Y `diry` -

* Z `dirz` -

Coordinates `coord` - ⊞ - Specifies the absolute 3D location the (U, V) target must translate to.

* X `coordx` -

* Y `coordy` -

* Z `coordz` -

U and V `uvsnap` - ⊞ - The primitive method allows the target point to be snapped to a point on another primitive specified by U and V here. See Warp Method parameter for details.

* `uvsnap1` -

* `uvsnap2` -
```
   |opFamily=SOP

}}

Deform along U `uwarp` - Determines whether the clay operation affects the U parametric direction. Both faces and surfaces respond to this option. If the primitives are face types and the toggle is off, clay doesn't change the inputs at all. If the inputs are surfaces and U is off, clay will pull the surfaces along the entire V direction (if V is on) or not at all.
U `u` - This value defines a point in the parametric space of a face, representing the location to be affected by the clay operation. This location is referred to as the "target". For surfaces, U defines a line of constant value in the parametric space of the primitive and requires a second coordinate - V - to specify a unique location (see the V> Page below). Spline faces and surfaces have explicit parametric spaces known as domains; since domains are not restricted to the unit range [0, 1], the Clay SOP maps U to the real domain value of the primitive. For polygons and meshes, U is expressed in terms of the number or vertices and columns respectively and in terms of their relative positions.
U Bias `uusebias` - Indicates whether the clay algorithm should use the bias it thinks works best for the given U parameter, or take the value explicitly stated beside the toggle. Since clay affects the CVs in the neighbourhood of the given parametric location, the bias can influence the amount of pull applied to the CVs on either side of this location. The effect is a slant of the "wave" the parametric point rides on - towards one side or the other.
U Bias `ubias` -
U Sharpness `usharp` - This parameter affects only NURBS curves and surfaces. The pull generated by clay on these primitives can be smooth or sharp depending on the position of the target relative to the underlying domain (the farther away from a knot, the rounded the bulge) and the knot multiplicity near the target (the higher the multiplicity the sharper the pull). If the pull is too round or affects too big an area in U, the U Sharpness parameter can reduce it by inserting one or more knots at the target U value. When the U Sharpness is zero no knots are inserted. When the U Sharpness is 1, all "degree" knots are inserted and the shape becomes very sharp. The U Sharpness varies in discrete steps; the number of steps equals the U degree of the spline.

**Note:** The range of the U Sharpness slider varies with the degree of the spline (i.e. the closer it is to 1, the more knots it adds). Since the number of knots added forms a discrete sequence, the slider will automatically jump to the valid positions.

Deform along V `vwarp` - Determines whether the clay operation affects the V parametric direction of the surface. If the inputs are surfaces and V if off, clay will pull the surfaces along the entire U direction (if U is on) or not at all. If both U and V are on, clay will pull the surface at the target (U, V) point specified in the U and V folders below. This option does not affect face types.
V `v` - This value affects only surface types. V defines a line of constant value in the parametric space of the surface and together with U specifies a unique location in that space. Spline surfaces have explicit parametric spaces known as domains; since domains are not restricted to the unit range [0, 1], the Clay SOP maps V to the real domain value of the surface. For meshes, V is expressed in terms of the number or rows and their relative positions.
V Bias `vusebias` - Indicates whether the clay algorithm should use the bias it thinks works best for the given V parameter, or take the value explicitly stated beside the toggle. Since clay affects the CVs in the neighbourhood of the given parametric location, the bias can influence the amount of pull applied to the CVs on either side of this location. The effect is a slant of the "wave" the parametric point rides on -- towards one side or the other.
V Bias `vbias` -
V Sharpness `vsharp` - This parameter affects only NURBS surfaces. The pull generated by clay on these primitives can be smooth or sharp depending on the position of the target relative to the underlying domain (the farther away from a knot, the rounded the bulge) and the knot multiplicity near the target (the higher the multiplicity the sharper the pull). If the pull is too round or affects too big an area in V, the V Sharpness parameter can reduce it by inserting one or more knots at the target V value. When the V Sharpness is zero no knots are inserted. When the V Sharpness is 1, all "degree" knots are inserted and the surface becomes very sharp. The V Sharpness varies in discrete steps; the number of steps equals the V degree of the spline.

Clip Blender CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Clip Blender CHOP

The Clip Blender CHOP is a an engine for blending, sequencing and scripting animation clips. It loads animation channel data that is formatted using Clip CHOPs. It reads clip CHOP paths from a specified DAT list which can be dynamically scripted. The Clip Blender plays clips from the list DAT; each time it reads a clip, it pop's the item off the list, and when the next clip plays through it will continue playing and popping clips off the list until it is empty. Once the list is empty the last animation in the sequence is looped.

Animation clips will typically come from an FBX or USD asset but can also be read using the Houdini bclip format or raw chan format. Animation clips found in FBX assets must be extracted from the asset hierarchy and then loaded speerately into a [Clip CHOP](Clip_CHOP.html "Clip CHOP"). All [Clip CHOP](Clip_CHOP.html "Clip CHOP")'s loaded into the same clipblender must have the same number of channels, all channel names must match and the all clips must be the same sample rate. If any of these 3 important requirements are not met, there will likely be animation glitches.

Use the [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") and [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") to extract information about its current state. See also the [Clip CHOP](Clip_CHOP.html "Clip CHOP") and [Clip DAT](Clip_DAT.html "Clip DAT").

Clock CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Clock CHOP

The Clock CHOP generates channels that reflect the time of year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond. It also has a moon cycle channel. It provides the date as separate channels and in different units. It presents the time in two ways:

* It generates **0-1 ramps** that reflect the time of year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond.
* It generates **integers that reflects the day-of month** etc. In this form the year channel is 4 for 2004, etc.

There are sunrise/sunset features, and you can override the day-of-year by inputting 1-6 channels into the CHOP.

* Since Program Start `program` -

Millisecond `msec` - If Output is Units, it is the current millisecond, starting at 0 at the start of a second, going up to 999 at the end of a second. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a millisecond.
Second `sec` - If Output is Units, it is the current second, starting at 0 for on-the-hour, going up to 59. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a second (45 seconds past the minute gives .75).
Minute `min` - If Output is Units, it is the current minute, starting at 0 for on-the-hour, going up to 59. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a minute (45 seconds past the minute gives .75).
Hour `hour` - If Output is Units, it is the current hour, starting at 0 for midnight and affected by AM/PM. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of an hour (15 minutes past the hour gives .25), taking into account the current minute and second.
AM/PM `ampm` - 0 if before noon, 1 if after noon.
Day of Week `wday` - If Output is Units, it is the actual day of the week, starting with 0 for Monday and 6 for Sunday.
Day of Month `day` - If Output is Units, it is the actual day of the month, so on March 20, it is 20. If Output is Fraction, it is fraction of a day of the current moment, so at 6:30 PM, it is .77, taking into account the hour, minute and second.
Day of Year `yday` - If Output is Units, it is the Day of year, starting with 0 for January 1. If it is Fraction, it is the same as Day of Month.

Composite CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Composite CHOP

The Composite CHOP layers (blends) the channels of one CHOP on the channels of another CHOP. The first input is the base input and the second is the layer input. It is designed for blending static multi-frame motion channels. Blending time-sliced channels or single-frame channels should be done with the [Blend CHOP](Blend_CHOP.html "Blend CHOP").

Over the interval of the layer, the layer channels are blended with the base channels. The contribution of the layer is eased-in and eased-out according to the Start, Peak, Release and End parameters. The base is unaffected outside the interval of the layer.

The Effect parameter determines the amount of contribution of the layer.

If Base Hold is 0, the layer input will completely replace the base input when the effect is 1. If the Base Hold is 1, the layer will be added to the base.

The interval of the output starts at the minimum of the base and layer. The interval of the output ends at the maximum of the base and layer. The base's extend conditions are used if the layer lies outside the base.

**Note:** If the third input is supplied, the Effect page will be overridden by the third input's first channel, which should contain the effect values over the range of the layer.

Constant CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Constant CHOP

The Constant CHOP creates new constant-value channels. Each channel can be named and assigned a different value. To create a channel, simply enter a channel name in a name parameter on the Constant page, then adjust the below value.

The CHOP interval (length of time) is one sample long by default (one sample at index 0 = frame 1). An interval range can be optionally set in the Channel page.

You can use [Pattern Expansion](Pattern_Expansion.html "Pattern Expansion") like `geo[1-4][xyz]` to generate multiple channels in one line.

A simple Constant CHOP with no inputs is the most common use of the CHOP. However, the channels names and values can be set up by connecting any CHOP to its input and clicking the Snapshot Input button (Snap page). This allows you to get some channels from another CHOP and adjust them with sliders in the Constant CHOP.

The second input can be used to add offsets to the constant values. When the second input (Active) is greater than zero, any change to the first input will be added to the output of the CHOP. This is useful for adjusting Constant CHOP values from external input devices like a MIDI slider box. For example you can connect the mouse or a MIDI slider box to a [Mouse In CHOP](Mouse_In_CHOP.html "Mouse In CHOP") or [MIDI In CHOP](MIDI_In_CHOP.html "MIDI In CHOP"), and you can raise/lower the Constant CHOP values by holding the Active input On, while moving the mouse or sliders.

* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common CHOP Info Channels](#Common_CHOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Constant Page

The channel is created if there is a name in the Name field. You can enter channel name patterns in the Name field, so you can create many channels with the same value. For example, try entering:

```
geo[1-5:2]:s[xyz]

in the first channel field instead of "`chan1`". See [Pattern Expansion](Pattern_Expansion.html "Pattern Expansion"), [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Constant `const` - Sequence of name/value pairs defining the channels
Name `const0name` - The name of the channel.
Value `const0value` - The value of the channel.

## Parameters - Snap Page

[![ConstantCHOPSnapPage.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/2/26/ConstantCHOPSnapPage.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:ConstantCHOPSnapPage.png)

The Constant CHOP can preset its channel names and values using the Snap page. We often want to grab some channels (Snapshot) and edit them later.

Snapshot Input `snap` - The optional first CHOP input on Constant is used when the Snapshot Input button is pressed. At this time, the channel names and values at the CHOP input at the current frame are used to initialize the channel names and values of the constant sliders.

To snap channels from other OPs, connect a Parameter CHOP to the Constant CHOP and hit `Snapshot Input`.

You can simulate the pressing of the Snapshot Input button from a script. To simulate the clicking of a CHOP dialog box button from a script use the [Par Class](Par_Class.html "Par Class") pulse() Method:

Example:

```
op('constant1').par.snap.pulse()

First Channel `first` - The First Channel parameter is used to select a smaller set of the incoming channels. This is useful if the number of incoming channels is greater than the 40 channels the Constant CHOP can hold, and you must break it into several CHOPs.
Active Needs Current `current` - This is used with the second input as described above, when you want to add a displacement to channels by using external devices or sources.
When Active Needs Current is On, the second CHOP input (the Active input) has an effect only if the Constant CHOP is the current CHOP.
When Active Needs Current is Off, the Constant CHOP is affected any time the Active input is on (greater than 0).
This is used by the Channel Editor when editing keyframes using CHOPs. An input device like a button in the Keyboard In CHOP or a MIDI keyboard can be fed to the Active input of many Constant CHOPs. Only the current CHOP will be affected if this option is On.

Single Sample `single` - Turn this Off to make constant channels that are longer than one Sample.
Start `start` - Start and end of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples). The parameters are expressed in the `Units` found on the Common page. To set the CHOP to be 100 samples long, Set `Units` to Samples, `Single Frame` Off and `Start` / `End` to 0 and 99.
Start Unit `startunit` - ⊞ - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

End `end` - Start and end of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples). The parameters are expressed in the `Units` found on the Common page. To set the CHOP to be 100 samples long, Set `Units` to Samples, `Single Frame` Off and `Start` / `End` to 0 and 99.
End Unit `endunit` - ⊞ - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.
Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before range).

Extend Right `right` - ⊞ - The right extend conditions (after range).

Default Value `defval` - The value used for the Default Value extend condition.

Extra Information for the Constant CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

MAT `mat` - When obtaining deform data from a MAT or a Deform In MAT, this is where that MAT is specified.

### Blending

[Blending](Blending.html "Blending") is summing the color value of the pixel being drawn and the pixel currently present in the Color-Buffer. Blending is typically used to simulate [Transparency](Transparency.html "Transparency").
The blending equation is:
`Final Pixel Value = (Source Blend * Source Color) + (Dest Blend * Destination Color)`

* Already Pre-Multiplied By Alpha `alreadypremult` -

* Pre-Multiply By Alpha in Shader `premultinshader` -

Depth Test `depthtest` - Enables and disables the Depth-Test. If the depth-test is disabled, depths values aren't written to the Depth-Buffer.
Depth Test Function `depthfunc` - ⊞ - The depth value of the pixel being drawn is compared to the depth value currently in the depth-buffer using this function. If the test passes then the pixel is drawn to the Frame-Buffer. If the test fails the pixel is discarded and no changes are made to the Frame-Buffer.

* Less Than `less` -

* Equal `equal` -

* Greater Than `greater` -

* Greater Than or Equal `greaterorequal` -

* Not Equal `notequal` -

* Always `always` -

### Depth Test

Depth-Testing is comparing the depth value of the pixel being drawn with the pixel currently in the [Frame-Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Frame-Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Frame-Buffer (page does not exist)"). A pixel that is determined to be in-front of the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will be drawn over it. Pixels that are determined to be behind the pixel currently in the Frame-Buffer will not be drawn. Depth-Testing allows geometry in a 3D scene to occlude geometry behind it, and be occluded by geometry in-front of it regardless of the order the geometry was drawn.

For a more detailed description of Depth-Testing, refer to the [Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Depth-Test "Depth-Test") article.

Write Depth Values `depthwriting` - If Write Depth Values is on, pixels that pass the depth-test will write their depth value to the Depth-Buffer. If this isn't on then no changes will be made to the Depth-Buffer, regardless of if the pixels drawn pass or fail the depth-test.
Discard Pixels Based on Alpha `alphatest` - This enables or disables the pixel alpha test.
Keep Pixels with Alpha `alphafunc` - ⊞ - This menu works in conjunction with the Alpha Threshold parameter below in determining which pixels to keep based on their alpha value.

Alpha Threshold `alphathreshold` - This value is what the pixel's alpha is compared to to determine if the pixel should be drawn. Pixels with alpha greater than the Alpha Threshold will be drawn. Pixels with alpha less than or equal to the Alpha Threshold will not be drawn.
Wire Frame `wireframe` - ⊞ - Enables and disables wire-frame rendering with the option of OpenGL Tesselated or Topology based wireframes.

* OpenGL Tesselated Wire Frame `tesselated` -

* Topology Wire Frame `topology` -

### Alpha Test

Alpha-testing allows you to choose to draw or not draw a pixel based on its alpha value.

Line Width `wirewidth` - This value is the width that the wires will be. This value is in pixels.
Cull Face `cullface` - ⊞ - Selects which faces to render.

* Use Render Setting `userender` - Use the render settings found in the Render or Render Pass TOP.

* Neither `neither` - Do not cull any faces, render everything.

* Back Faces `backfaces` - Cull back faces, render front faces.

* Front Faces `frontfaces` - Cull front faces, render back faces.

* Both Faces `bothfaces` - Cull both faces, render nothing.

Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset` - Turns on the polygon offset feature.
Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor` -
Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits` -

### Wire Frame

The wire-frame feature will render the geometry as wire-frame, using the actual primitive type used in the render. What this means is surfaces like Metaballs, NURBs and Beziers will become a wire-frame of the triangles/triangle-strips used to render them (since these types of primitives can't be natively rendered in OpenGL).

### Cull Face

The cull face parameter will cull faces from the render output. This can be used as an optimization or sometimes to remove artifacts. See [Back-Face Culling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Back-Face_Culling "Back-Face Culling") for more infomation.

### Polygon Depth Offset

This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly on-top of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](Z-Fighting.html "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](Polygon_Depth_Offset.html "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing [shadows](Shadows.html "Shadows").

Constraint COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Constraint COMP

A Constraint COMP is used to restrict the movement of the bodies in a set of [Actor COMPs](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP"). Currently this can be done in a few ways: point to point, hinge or slider. Constraints can either be applied on a single body or between two bodies. Constraints can be used to create connectivity between bodies, or to create bodies that can move but need to have that movement restricted in some way. Some examples of constraints in the real world: a train, a door, an arm.

If a point to point constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). It will still have all 3 degrees of freedom for rotation (ie. All 3 axes), but the 3 degrees of freedom for translation will all be constrained. If a point to point constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be similarly constrained to 3 DOF. However, they will be able to move (translate) along all 3 axes but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. By using this constraint method, a chain of bodies can be created. For instance, point to point constraints can be used to simulate train cars connected to each other.

If a hinge constraint is applied to a single body, then that body will be restricted to 1 DOF relative to the other body. It will only be able to rotate around 1 axis, and that axis is defined using the Axis parameter on the Constraint COMP. Much like the point to point constraint, the hinge also as a pivot point around which it will rotate. If a hinge constraint is applied between two bodies, then they will both be able to move with 3 DOF but they will do it connected to each other at their pivot points. However, they will still only be able to rotate around their respective axis. The simplest example of a hinge constraint is a door.

If a slider constraint is applied to a single body, then that body's translation/rotation will be constrained to just that axis. In other words, the body can only move along that axis (either direction) and can only rotate along that axis (either direction).

Active `active` - Toggle the constraint on/off in the simulation.
Type `type` - ⊞ - The type of constraint to create: point to point, hinge, or slider.

* Point To Point `p2p` -

* Hinge `hinge` -

* Slider `slider` -

Body to Body `bodytobody` - Toggle body to body mode on/off. Body to body mode creates a constraint between two bodies (Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies). When toggled off it will create constrain bodies individually. If Actor 1 Bodies and Actor 2 Bodies contain the same number of referenced bodies, then this mode will create a constraint between each respective pair. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string "0 1 2", and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string "3 4 5" then this will create 3 constraints: 0->3, 1->4, 2->5. It is a 1 to 1 relationship between these two parameters. However, if Actor 1 Bodies has more bodies than Actor 2 Bodies, then the remaining "unmatched" bodies of Actor 1 Bodies will instead be individually constrained. For instance, if Actor 1 Bodies contains the string "0 1 2" and Actor 2 Bodies contains the string "3 4", then two constraints will be created between bodies: 0->3, 1->4. Body 2 will be constrained individually. If Actor 2 Bodies contains more bodies than Actor 1 Bodies, then any unmatched bodies in Actor 2 Bodies will simply be disregarded (no constraint created for them).
Collisions between Bodies `collisions` - Turns on/off collisions between the body to body constraints.
Display Constraint `dispcom` - Turns on/off the display of the constraint guide in the viewer.
Actor COMP `actor1` - A reference to an Actor COMP. This specifies the Actor COMP of which you want to constrain some bodies.
Actor Bodies `bodies1` - A list (regular expression) of the IDs of the bodies in actor1 to constrain. If an Actor COMP contains N bodies, then body IDs will go from 0 to N-1 for that Actor COMP. The number of bodies can be verified using the [Bullet Solver CHOP](Bullet_Solver_CHOP.html "Bullet Solver CHOP").

Actor COMP `actor2` - A reference to an Actor COMP. This specifies the Actor COMP of which you want to constrain some bodies. This Actor COMP is only used when body to body mode is toggled on.
Actor Bodies `bodies2` - A list (regular expression) of the IDs of the bodies in actor2 to constrain. If an Actor COMP contains N bodies, then body IDs will go from 0 to N-1 for that Actor COMP. The number of bodies can be verified using the Bullet Solver CHOP.

Display `display` - Specifies if the panel is displayed or hidden. Changing this parameter may incur some layout processing costs. For simple cases, such as overlays it is more performant to adjust the opacity parameter instead.
Enable `enable` - Allows you to prevent all interaction with this panel.
Help DAT `helpdat` - Lets you specify the path to a [Text DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_DAT "Text DAT") whose content will be displayed as a rollover pop-up help for the control panel.
Cursor `cursor` - ⊞ - Changes the cursor displayed when cursor is over the panel.

Multi-Touch `multitouch` - ⊞ - When enabled, this panel will process the first touch it gets in a similar manner to how it processes a mouse click, with updates to u, v, state etc. The touch event must be initiated from the panel. Subsequent touches are ignored. If this panel handles multi-touch events via the [Multi Touch In DAT](https://docs.derivative.ca/Multi_Touch_In_DAT "Multi Touch In DAT"), you may want to disable Built-in Multi-Touch so it won't interfere with script processing.

Constrain Cursor `constraincursor` - Constrains the cursor to this panel, keeping it inside once it enters.
Click Through `clickthrough` - When enabled all mouse clicks are ignored by this [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component").
Use Mouse Wheel `mousewheel` - Turn on to capture events when the mouse wheel is used over the panel.
Mouse UV Buttons `uvbuttons` - ⊞ - Allows you to specify which mouse buttons update the uv [Panel Values](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Value "Panel Value").

Relative UV `mouserel` - When enabled the uv [Panel Values](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Value "Panel Value") will reflect relative mouse movement.
Drag Edges to Resize `resize` - ⊞ - Four checkboxes allow you to enable resizing a panel by grabbing the corresponding edge or corner: Resize Left, Right, Bottom, Top.

Background Alpha `bgalpha` - Set the alpha value for the background.
Background TOP `top` - Allows you to specify a [TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/TOP "TOP") as the background for the panel.
TOP Fill `topfill` - ⊞ - This menu specifies the way the Background TOP will fill the panel's background.

Disable Alpha `disablealpha` - Set the alpha value for the disable color.
Multiply RGB by Alpha `multrgb` - Multiplies the RGB channels by the alpha channel.
Composite `composite` - ⊞ - Selects how the panel is composited with its siblings panels. See the [Composite TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Composite_TOP "Composite TOP") for a description of the various composite methods.

Please refer to [Drag-and-Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop "Drag-and-Drop") for a full explanation on how Drag and Drop between Panel Components functions.

Drag Script `dragscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when starting to drag a Panel Component. Please refer to the Drag Script section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drag_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Drop Destination Script `dropdestscript` - Specify a script that will be executed when the dragged Panel Component is dropped. A temporary network is created and the component (or the alternative operator specified in Dropped Component) is copied to this network. You can add or modify operators in this network. Please refer to the Drop Destination Script section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Destination_Scripts "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Drop Types `droptypescript` - If a drop destination script is specified, you can also add a DAT table with a list of return types that the drop destination script will provide. Return types can be one of the op types (COMP,TOP,CHOP,SOP,MAT,DAT), channel, or supported filetypes. Please refer to the Drop Types section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Types "Drag-and-Drop") page.
Dropped Operator `paneldragop` - The Dropped Component parameter is the easiest way to specify an alternative operator to drop. Note that this alternative operator must exist, otherwise the component itself will be dropped. The alternative is only used when dropping onto a network or control panel. Text pasted via dragging and dropping, or files saved via dropping onto the desktop, will still use the original.
On Dropping Into `drop` - ⊞ - Specify if this Panel Component accepts items that are dropped onto it.

Drop Script `dropscript` - A component's Drop Script is run when you drop another component or an external file into that component. Please refer to the Drop Scripts - Text section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Scripts_-_Text "Drag-and-Drop") page.

Alternatively specify a Table DAT in the drop script field. TouchDesigner will automatically look for 2 columns in the table. The first column should indicate the data type and the second should indicate the Text DAT that holds the script to process that data type. Please refer to the Drop Script - Tables section of the [Drag and Drop](https://docs.derivative.ca/Drag-and-Drop#Drop_Script_-_Tables "Drag-and-Drop") page.

The Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions. Please see [extensions](https://docs.derivative.ca/Extensions "Extensions") for more information.

The Common parameter page sets the component's [node viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer") and [clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone") relationships.

Global Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](https://docs.derivative.ca/Global_OP_Shortcut "Global OP Shortcut").
Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Operators "Internal Operators").
OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](https://docs.derivative.ca/Internal_Operators "Internal Operators").
Node View `nodeview` - ⊞ - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the [Node Viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer"). Some options will not be available depending on the Component type ([Object Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Object_Component "Object Component"), [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component"), Misc.)

Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
Keep in Memory `keepmemory` - Used only for [Panel Components](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") this keeps the panel in memory to it doesn't reload every time it is displayed.
Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](https://docs.derivative.ca/Clone "Clone").
Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
External .tox `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
Reload .tox on Start `reloadtoxonstart` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](https://docs.derivative.ca/Custom_Parameters "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox").
Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/.tox ".tox").
Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
Re-Init Network `reinitnet` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present), followed by re-initializing itself from its master, if it's a clone.

The Container component type is a [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") that holds, lays out and displays any number of other Panel Components.

An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Object_Component "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network_Path "Network Path").

(1) The TouchDesigner window is made of a menu bar at the top, a [Timeline](https://docs.derivative.ca/Timeline "Timeline") at the bottom, plus one of a choice of Layouts in the middle. A Layout is made on one or more Panes, each Pane can contain a Network Editor, Viewer, Panel, etc. See [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane") and [Bookmark](https://docs.derivative.ca/Bookmark "Bookmark"). (2) Nodes in a network are arranged using Layout commands in the RMB menu.

A custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using [Panel Components](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel_Component "Panel Component").

A Window in TouchDesigner is a window in Microsoft Windows or macOS that contains either (1) the TouchDesigner editing interface that exists in [Designer Mode](https://docs.derivative.ca/Designer_Mode "Designer Mode"), or (2) a user-created [Panel](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel "Panel") inside a [Window Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Window_COMP "Window COMP"). The user-created windows can span [Multiple Monitors](https://docs.derivative.ca/Multiple_Monitors "Multiple Monitors") borderless, or be floating windows with borders, or popups.

An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](https://docs.derivative.ca/Script "Script") or [GLSL](https://docs.derivative.ca/GLSL "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](https://docs.derivative.ca/Table_DAT "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

A [Link](https://docs.derivative.ca/Link "Link"). The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family").

A Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP [Exports](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export"), node [Paths](https://docs.derivative.ca/Network_Path "Network Path") in parameters, and [expressions](https://docs.derivative.ca/Expression "Expression") in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a [Wire](https://docs.derivative.ca/Wire "Wire") that connects nodes in the same [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family").

There are 2 kinds of parenting. The "parent component" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root `/` is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also [3D Parenting](https://docs.derivative.ca/3D_Parenting "3D Parenting") and panel [Parenting](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parent "Parent").

An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.

The width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the [Movie File In TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Movie_File_In_TOP "Movie File In TOP") can set the image resolution. See [Aspect Ratio](https://docs.derivative.ca/TOP_Generator_Common_Page "TOP Generator Common Page") for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.

The sub-[Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") of [Components](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") that are used to create custom interactive 2D control [panels](https://docs.derivative.ca/Panel "Panel") (Container, Widget, Text COMP Slider, Button, etc.).

A set of commands located in a Text DAT that are triggered to run under certain conditions. There are two scripting languages in TouchDesigner: [Python](https://docs.derivative.ca/Python "Python") and the original [Tscript](https://docs.derivative.ca/Tscript "Tscript"). Scripts and single-line commands can also be run in the [Textport](https://docs.derivative.ca/Textport "Textport").

Any of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They "cook" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See [Node](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node "Node").

An [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](https://docs.derivative.ca/Channel "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](https://docs.derivative.ca/Sample "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

A [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.

MATs or Materials are an [Operator Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") that applies a [Shader](https://docs.derivative.ca/Shader "Shader") to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.

A form of [DATs](https://docs.derivative.ca/DAT "DAT") (Data Operators) that is structured as rows and columns of text strings.

The sub-[Family](https://docs.derivative.ca/Operator_Family "Operator Family") of [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A [Geometry Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Geometry_COMP "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Camera_COMP "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Light_COMP "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

Operator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include [Parent Shortcuts](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parent_Shortcut "Parent Shortcut") for accessing a component from within that component, and [Global OP Shortcuts](https://docs.derivative.ca/Global_OP_Shortcut "Global OP Shortcut") that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.

The viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the [Node Viewer](https://docs.derivative.ca/Node_Viewer "Node Viewer")), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane") that graphically shows the results of an operator.

Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the [Replicator COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Replicator_COMP "Replicator COMP").

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](https://docs.derivative.ca/Export "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Speed_CHOP "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](https://docs.derivative.ca/Root "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pane "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](https://docs.derivative.ca/Folder "Folder").

TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](https://docs.derivative.ca/Component "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.

Every component contains a network of operators that create and modify data. The operators are connected by wires that define where data is routed after the operator cooks its inputs and generates an output.

* To Table `table` - Converts regular text into table format.

Remove Blank Lines `removeblank` - When enabled, do not convert blank lines into empty rows.
Split Cells at `delimiters` - A list of individual characters to use to split the string into cells. The delimiters are used independently. That is, if `$%` is used in this parameter, the cells will be split at `$` OR `%`, not only at `$%`. A [Substitute DAT](Substitute_DAT.html "Substitute DAT") can be used to collapse a more complex delimiter into a single character to be use for the conversion.

# Convert SOP

The Convert SOP converts geometry from one geometry type to another type. Types include polygon, mesh, Bezier patche, particle and sphere primitive.

* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
From Type `fromtype` - ⊞ - Determines which geometry by type will be converted. The default is All Types:

* All Types `all` - All geometry will be converted.

* Sphere `sphere` -

* Tube `tube` -

* Particles `part` -

* Meta-ball `metaball` -

* Mesh `mesh` -

* Bezier Curve `bezcurve` -

* Bezier Surface `bezsurf` -

* NURBS Curve `nurbcurve` -

* NURBS Surface `nurbsurf` -

* Circle `circle` -

* Triangle Strip `tristrip` -

* Triangle Fan `trifan` -

Convert to `totype` - ⊞ - Determines what the above From Type geometry will be converted to. Conversion to Polygons is the default:

**Notes**:
Not all geometry can be converted to specific types. For example, a triangulated polygon surface to a single NURBS surface, or a Mesh sphere into a primitive sphere. Also, certain conversions will preserve shapes. For example, converting a Bzier curve to a NURBS curve or a polygonal mesh to a NURBS Surface.

**Circle Notes**: Converting to primitive circles is available for action users who are used to working with polygon circles so that you can convert them to primitive circles for the TouchDesigner Skeleton, Arm, and Limb SOPs.

**Trimmed Surface Notes**: If the primitive to be converted is a curve (NURBS or Bezier) and is flat, a trimmed surface will be generated such that the visible piece coincides with the curve. If the curve is not flat, it will be converted to a non-trimmed surface. The advantage of the trimmed solution is that it yields a very clean surface and handles concave curves perfectly.

* Trimmed Bezier Surface `trimbezsurf` -

* Trimmed NURBS Surface `trimnurbsurf` -

Connectivity `surftype` - ⊞ - This option is used to select how the points of the created surface are connected.

* Rows `rows` - Creates horizontal lines.

* Columns `cols` - Creates vertical lines.

* Rows and Columns `rowcol` - Both Rows and Columns. Looks like Quadrilaterals in wire frame display, but all polygons are open (if the primitive type is polygon).

* Triangles `triangles` - Build the grid with Triangles.

* Quadrilaterals `quads` - Generates sides composed of quadrilaterals (default).

* Alternating Triangles `alttriangles` - Generates triangles that are opposed; similar to the Triangles option.

## Parameters - Level of Detail Page

This affects the use of the U/V/Trim Curve fields:

* For Level of Detail: U, V, Trim Curve Level of Detail

In a spline's case, the span is the curve arc between two breakpoints. The number of divisions per span specifies how many points to be created between the two breakpoints. If the number of divisions = 0, a single segment will connect the two breakpoints; if number of divisions = 1, two edges will be created; etc.
The advantage of Divisions over the Level of Detail is that it tells you exactly how many points you'll end up with - extremely useful for polygonal modeling.

U `lodu` - When set to Level of Detail, controls the number of points or CVs that are used in the newly generated geometry depending on the above setting. Converting a NURBS surface into a polygon mesh with a Level of Detail of 1 results in a fair approximation of the NURBS surface whereas a value of 2 generates a very dense polygonal mesh.

When set to Divisions per Span, specificies the number of divisions per span.

**Tip:** Animate the Level of Detail based on how close your character or geometry is to the camera by using the `primdist()` expression. Then the detail will increase/decrease as the camera gets closer/further away.

Trim-Curve `lodtrim` - The trimmed part of a surface will be converted using this Trim lod (level of detail) instead of using an implicit "1" constant.

## Parameters - Divisions per Span Page

* For Divisions per Span: U, V, Number of Trim Curve Divisions.

U Order `orderu` - When converting to a spline type, this specifies the degree + 1 of the U or V basis function.

Paste Coordinates

* From Feature Surfaces - The resulting mesh will have the shape of the paste hierarchy (i.e. the top-most features will determine the shape).
* From Base Surface - The resulting mesh will take the shape of the bottom-most surface.

Paste Attributes

* From Feature Surfaces - Each mesh point has the attributes of the top-most feature at that location.
* From Base Surface - The resulting mesh will inherit the primitive attributes of the root surface (e.g. the material), and the point attributes will be those of the root surface as well.

By using base coordinates and feature attributes you are, in fact, pasting attributes onto the surface.

Preserve Original `new` - When checked, the original geometry will be retained along with the converted geometry.
Interpolate Through Hulls `interphull` - This option applies to the conversion between polygonal faces and grids to NURBS and Bzier surfaces and curves. When selected, the resulting curves retain the same topology as the original polygon. When not selected, the polygon points are used as a hull to define the new curve or surface.
Particle Type `prtype` - ⊞ - Selects how the particles are rendered.

* Render as Lines `lines` - Each particle will be rendered as a 2-point line, with the length determined based on the particles velocity. If the particle has no velocity it will just be a single pixel in size.

* Render as Point Sprites `pointprites` - For use with the [Point Sprite MAT](Point_Sprite_MAT.html "Point Sprite MAT"). Each particle is a square of pixels that always face the camera. The size of the square is determined by parameters in the Point Sprite and the `pscale` vertex/point attribute. The point sprites will have texture coordinates generated for them automatically also ((0,0) in the bottom left and (1,1) in the top right).

Face to Surface Conversion - When converting from a set of polygons to a mesh, a single mesh will result only if [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP").

Otherwise, each polygon is converted individually into a mesh. In fact, any individual face can be converted to any surface. This is accomplished by cutting the face into three or four adjacent sections, and then creating a patch from them.

Extra Information for the Convert SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Convolve TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Convolve TOP

The Convolve TOP uses a DAT table containing numeric coefficients. For each pixel, it combines its RGBA values and it's neighboring pixels' RGBA values by multiplying the values by the corresponding coefficients in the table, adding the results together. For example, if the table is 5 rows and 5 columns, the pixel and its 24 neighbors are combined.

Example coefficient for 3x3 blur, edge, emboss, sharpen and vertical slope kernels. Be sure to turn on 'Normalize Coefficients' to use these coefficients as -is:

## Parameters - Convolve Page

Coefficients DAT `dat` - The DAT containing the rows and columns of coefficients.
Normalize Coefficients `normalize` - This will normalize the coefficients before using them in the convolve. Normaliziation is done by summing all the coefficients and dividing every coefficient by that sum. Note: If the coefficients add up to 0, then this parameter does nothing.
Apply to Alpha `applytoalpha` - When off, the alpha channel will not be convolved.
Offset `offset` - After the convolution, this value will be added to the R, G and B of the pixel (and A if enabled).

Extra Information for the Convolve TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Copy CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Copy CHOP

The Copy CHOP produces multiple copies of the second input along the timeline of the first input. The first input provides the trigger signals or the convolve levels.

The Copy CHOP can be used to produce a motion every time a trigger occurs. It can be used to trigger motion, such as eyelid blinks. The copies it produces can be identical, or the copies can be re-cooked each time a copy is added to the timeline. It is useful for triggering a sound multiple times, where the sounds may overlap in time.

Each copy that is added to the output can be completely different than any other copy. By passing variables through the Variables page, the second (Copy) input can be any CHOP chain that uses the variables and recooks to create each copy.

# Copy SOP

The Copy SOP lets you make copies of the geometry of other SOPs and apply a transformation to each copy.

It also allows you to copy geometry to points on an input template.

Specifies a subset of template primitives from which to copy onto. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Source Group `sourcegrp` - Specifies a subset of input primitives to copy from. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Template Group `templategrp` - Specifies a subset of template primitives from which to copy onto. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Number of Copies `ncy` - Sets number of Copies to be made of the source. For a template input, it specifies the number of copies to be placed at each point of the template.
Primitives per Point `nprims` - Defines how many primitives to copy from each point.
Rotate to Normal `nml` - Only used when a template input is specified. If the template is a sphere, and the first input is a circle, a circle is placed at each point of the sphere. With this option on, all the circles will re-orient to face the surface of the sphere (a default sphere has normals radiating outwards from the center).

If an up attribute exists on the template geometry, then this will be used (along with the normal) to fully define the rotates for the copies. An up attribute is created with the Point SOP.

Transform Cumulative `cum` - Each transformation "builds" on the location left by the one before it. Transformations are cumulative as the Copy SOP produces new copies.
Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Sets the overall transform order for the transformations. The Transform Order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results using the exact same values. Choose the appropriate order from the menu.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These allow you to specify the Translation (how much it moves over in a given direction), Rotation, and the Scale between each copy. Three columns are given for X, Y, and Z coordinates. Guide geometry is provided for the Pivot's translations. The Pivot is represented by a single red dot in the Viewport. Changing the Pivot parameters moves this point of reference.

Uniform Scale `scale` - Uniform Scale allows you to shrink or enlarge geometry along all three axes simultaneously.
Normals Maintain Length `vlength` - Vector type attributes (i.e. normals, velocity) maintain the same length under transforms. i.e. When geometry is scaled, the normals remain constant in length.
Create Output Groups `newg` - If selected, this creates a group for each copy number, and places each primitive created at that stage into it.
Copy Groups `copyg` - Defines the base name of the groups created.
Look At `lookat` - Orients the copied geometry to lookat, or point to, the [object](Object.html "Object") component specified in the parameter.
Up Vector `upvector` - ⊞ - When specifying a Look At, it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat object passes through the Y axis of the target object.

* X `upvectorx` -

* Y `upvectory` -

* Z `upvectorz` -

Stamping is allowed in any parameter in TouchDesigner. The only requirement is that the stamped parameter is upstream in some fashion from the Copy SOP doing the stamping.

Stamp Inputs `stamp` - When enabled, it will Stamp proceeding variables for each input copied.
Copy `copy` - Sequence of stamp variables
Param `copy0param` - Token of each stamp variable. Stamped parameters are accessible via the global `fetchStamp()` method in the [td Module](Td_Module.html "Td Module") in python, or `param()` in tscript. See the example, below.
Value `copy0value` - Value of each stamp variable. Stamped parameters are accessible via the global `fetchStamp()` method in the [td Module](Td_Module.html "Td Module") in python, or `param()` in tscript. See the example, below.

## Parameters - Attributes Page

This page allows you to determine how point attributes on template geometry affect attributes on the source geometry. The template attribute can modify the source in four ways:

* Set - Override the source attribute.
* Multiply - Multiply the source attribute.
* Add - Get Added to the source attribute.
* Sub - Get Subtracted from the source attribute.

The template point attributes are able to affect point, primitive, or vertex attributes in the source geometry simply by entering values in the appropriate fields.

Use Template Point Attribs `doattr` - Enables the parameters below to allow template point attributes to be applied to the copied source geometry.
Copy to Point `setpt` - ⊞ - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's points.

Copy to Primitive `setprim` - ⊞ - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's primitives.

Copy to Vertex `setvtx` - ⊞ - Copy the attributes to the source geometry's vertices.

Multiply Point `mulpt` - ⊞ - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's point attributes.

Multiply Primitive `mulprim` - ⊞ - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's primitive attributes.

Multiply Vertex `mulvtx` - ⊞ - Multiply the attributes with the source geometry's vertex attributes.

Add Point `addpt` - ⊞ - Add the attributes to the source geometry's point attributes.

Add Primitive `addprim` - ⊞ - Add the attributes to the source geometry's primitive attributes.

Add Vertex `addvtx` - ⊞ - Add the attributes to the source geometry's vertex attributes.

Subtract Point `subpt` - ⊞ - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's point attributes.

Subtract Primitive `subprim` - ⊞ - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's primitive attributes.

Subtract Vertex `subvtx` - ⊞ - Subtract the attributes from the source geometry's vertex attributes.

## Tips

You can use the `me.copyTotal` python member to calculate the degrees of rotation for a given number of copies. For example, if you have 28 copies, you can set the rotation to be: `360/me.copyTotal` - this would automatically give you 12.8571 degrees, evenly spacing your 28 copies around the full circumference of the circle.

Using a Particle SOP as the Template object, you can copy objects defined in the Copy Data input to each particle template. This allows you, for example, to copy a Bee to each particle to create a swarm of bees.

Make a series of copies about an axis, and skin them to achieve lathe-like effects, similar to the results achieved with the Revolve SOP.

## Examples

### Creating Stamped Geometry

1. Place a Circle SOP, and set its type to Polygon.
2. Set the number of Divisions in the Circle to: `fetchStamp("sides",3)` The method `fetchStamp()` returns the value of the global parameter sides. If it is not yet defined it will return a value of 3.
3. Append a Copy SOP, and set the Number of Copies to `5`; and set Translate X to: `2.5` .
4. In the Stamp page of the Copy SOP, turn on Stamp Inputs. Set Param 1 to: `sides` and `me.copyIndex+3`[![CopySOPStampPage.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/d/d9/CopySOPStampPage.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:CopySOPStampPage.png)
5. This creates a triangle on the first stamped copy; a square on the next; a pentagon on the third, and so on. The geometry for each copy is cooked separately.

[![CopySOPStampExample.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/0/02/CopySOPStampExample.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:CopySOPStampExample.png)

You can set multiple stamp Params at once and they can be used anywhere in the ancestry of the copy's input.

Count CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Count CHOP

The Count CHOP counts the number of times a channel crosses a trigger or release threshold. It operates in either static or realtime ("Cook to Current Frame") mode.

The trigger value by default is 0, so the count occurs when the input goes from below (or equal to) 0 to a value that is greater than zero.

Crossing the trigger threshold (increasing past the trigger level) creates a trigger event. Similarly, crossing the release threshold (decreasing past the release level) creates a release event. Operations may also be performed while the input remain above or below the trigger or release levels. On each event, the count may be increased or decreased by 1 or the time, or reset to zero. The time per sample varies with the sample rate (i.e. for 100 samples/second, the time for each sample would be 1/100th of a second).

The optional second input is a reset input. The first channel is interpreted as a channel containing reset pulses. Whenever this channel is non-zero, the count for all channels is reset.

The third input is labeled "Increment Value". It allows you to specify a value other than the default +-1 to count. If you want to count by Fives, then put a channel with a value of 5 in this input. It will increment by 5 each count, or by 5 per second depending on the On / Off menus on the second page.

CPlusPlus SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# CPlusPlus SOP

The CPlusPlus SOP allows you to make custom SOP operators by writing your own plugin using C++.

See [Write a CPlusPlus Plugin](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_CPlusPlus_Plugin "Write a CPlusPlus Plugin") and the other articles in the [C++ category](Category_C%2b%2b.html "Category:C++") for more detailed information on how to make .dll for use with this SOP.

The C++ code can be written for GPU or CPU loading. The ease of developing C++ code for either of these two options are fairly similar. Nevertheless, by setting the “`directToGPU`” flag within the C++ code, only one of these modes is recognized as a valid mode. Different classes are dedicated for each of these two modes, so bear in mind that setting the “`directToGPU`” flag to “`true`” or “`false`” requires different classes and functions to be called within either of `execute()` or `executeVBO()`.

In CPU mode, the geometry data can be added one at a time or all at once. As well, in CPU mode the CPlusPlus SOP can use wired SOP inputs and SOP to DAT, SOP to CHOP, or SOP output OPs as well. Additionally DAT, CHOP, and TOP 'non-wired' input operators can be used as custom parameters. In this case, the custom parameters must be first handled in the C++ code to be able to accept any input from the other operators.

The GPU direct mode is similar to CPU mode, but it cannot use any output SOPs downstream or be accessed by SOP to DAT or SOP to CHOP operators. In GPU direct mode the data is added to the VBO buffers immediately which improves the performance through faster updating, however the size of the vertices and face array indices must be known prior to filling the buffers.

Example for CPlusPlus SOP as a Visual Studio project in Windows are available in `C:/Program Files/Derivative/TouchDesigner/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP` or your custom TouchDesigner installation folder. (NOTE: On macOS it is here: `TouchDesigner.app/Contents/Resources/tfs/Samples/CPlusPlus/SimpleShapesSOP`)

**Custom Parameters** - Custom Parameters can be automatically created by the C++ SOP `.dll`. This custom parameter page can be removed, edited, or appended to from within the `setupParameters()` function in SimpleShapes.cpp. The defined custom parameters can be enabled or disabled depending on whether they are valid for a specific task or not.

**Geometry Data** - Geometry within the C++ SOP code can be defined by any algorithm or even imported from external files. The possible geometries are triangular meshes and particle systems. Note that if your original geometry has polygons with more than 3 vertices, they must be converted to triangles with known and valid vertex indices, before being added to the list of triangles.

The geometry data for exporting to TouchDesigner can have point, normal, and texture coordinates, RGBA colors, triangle information in case of meshes and/or particle systems, as well as custom attributes with an arbitrary name, float or integer type, and up to 4 components (ie. Cd0, Cd1, Cd2, Cd3).

## Introduction[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Introduction")]

Audio is managed with CHOPs in TouchDesigner. CHOPs can generate sounds and can read sounds into TouchDesigner from external sources. Audio can be generated, played from audio files, filtered, mixed and recorded.

The ways to obtain audio in CHOPs include: from files, movies, microphones or line in. These are described in detail in the section below. To hear audio output from CHOPs, send the audio to an [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP").

For example, the [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP") can generate a constant-frequency audio signal. The [Trigger CHOP](Trigger_CHOP.html "Trigger CHOP") takes an on-off control from TouchDesigner, and generates a volume envelope with a delay, attack, decay, sustain and release transition that can multiplied with an audio CHOP with a [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") controlling its loudness. The [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") and [Audio Dynamics CHOP](Audio_Dynamics_CHOP.html "Audio Dynamics CHOP") act as a mixer and the [Audio Para EQ CHOP](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Para EQ CHOP") filters the spectrum of audio.

## Quick Audio Startup[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Quick Audio Startup")]

To quickly get audio going, try the following: [File:Audio with CHOPS ex.tox](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Audio_with_CHOPS_ex.tox "File:Audio with CHOPS ex.tox")

* Connect a default LFO CHOP to a default Audio Oscillator CHOP.
* Connect the Audio Oscillator CHOP to an Audio Device Out CHOP.
* You should hear a rising and falling tone.
* Connect the LFO CHOP to a new Audio Oscillator CHOP and set the oscillator's Base Frequency to 330.
* Connect the two Oscillators to a Merge CHOP. Connect the Merge CHOP to the Audio Device Out CHOP. You should hear one oscillator in each left and right channels.

Next use an Audio File In CHOP as a sound source, connecting it to the Audio Device Out CHOP.

## Loading Audio[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Loading Audio")]

[Audio File In CHOP](Audio_File_In_CHOP.html "Audio File In CHOP") - loads audio from a file as it plays. This method of streaming uses very little memory as it only loads the samples of audio it needs at the time, ideal for large audio files. The CHOP channels created are [time-sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing").

[Audio Movie CHOP](Audio_Movie_CHOP.html "Audio Movie CHOP") - loads the audio track from a movie that has been loaded into a [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP"). Playback is controlled from Movie File In TOP. The CHOP channels created are [time-sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing").

[File In CHOP](File_In_CHOP.html "File In CHOP") - loads the entire audio file into CHOPs. The audio is loaded into CHOPs at the sample rate of the audio file. The higher the sample rate, the more memory CHOPs will use to load the audio. The channels created are not [time-sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing"). When completely loaded into CHOPs, it is easy to manipulate the audio downstream with additional Filter CHOPs; stretch, splice, pitch, volume, etc. Care must be taken running real-time systems with large audio files and high sample rates, as CPU usage for these operations is very high.

[Audio Device In CHOP](Audio_Device_In_CHOP.html "Audio Device In CHOP") - streams audio into TouchDesigner from any audio input device attached to the computer. The CHOP channels created are [time-sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing").

[Audio Play CHOP](Audio_Play_CHOP.html "Audio Play CHOP") - plays back a sound file directly to the audio output device. Great for simple triggering of sounds. Plays back just a single file or selects from a list of files stored in a [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") list. Can also be triggered using the Tscript `audioplay` Command. Audio is not passed further down the CHOP network.

### Scrub Controls [[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Scrub Controls")]

When using a Audio File In CHOP, audio can be cued or scrubbed at least 3 ways:

* Audio File In's parameter Play Mode must first be set to Sequential. Select a Cue Point and press Cue Pulse.
* Audio File In's parameter Play Mode must first be set to Specify Index. using the Index parameter. Turn off the Repeat parameter to stop audio buzzing when not scrubbing.
* When using the Audio Movie CHOP, scrubbing the audio can be done through the Movie File In TOP which is referenced. As the movie playback is scrubbed, the audio will follow.

Using a File In CHOP, audio can be scrubbed by scrubbing TouchDesigner's main [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") throughout the frame range of the File In CHOP.

### Repeating Audio[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Repeating Audio")]

When using an [Audio File In CHOP](Audio_File_In_CHOP.html "Audio File In CHOP"), set the Repeat parameter to On.

Using a [File In CHOP](File_In_CHOP.html "File In CHOP"), which statically loads the entire audio file, you can set the Extend Left and Extend Right parameters to Cycle.

[Audio Play CHOPs](Audio_Play_CHOP.html "Audio Play CHOP") need to be repeatedly triggered to repeat the audio.

### TouchDesigner Audio Output Volume[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: TouchDesigner Audio Output Volume")]

The Audio Device Out CHOP sets the overall output level to the speakers. This is sent to the volume controls in Windows.

## Outputting Audio to a File[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Outputting Audio to a File")]

You can output the audio in any CHOP using the [RMB](Mouse_Click.html "Mouse Click") menu on the CHOP. Select Save Data Channels in the menu and hit the arrow button to see the file format suffixes that can be used on your output files, such as `.aif`. You can check the file by playing it with [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [QuickTime](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL837) or another audio player.

Note, the CHOP may be [time-sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing"), in which case you will need to first record it into a [Record CHOP](Record_CHOP.html "Record CHOP") or [Trail CHOP](Trail_CHOP.html "Trail CHOP").

## Modifying Audio[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Modifying Audio")]

* [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") - Increase/decrease volume, mix sounds, stereo to mono, perform functions of a level mixer.
* [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP") - Make audible tones & LFO (low frequency oscillator).
* [Constant CHOP](Constant_CHOP.html "Constant CHOP") - Provide constant-pitch control for oscillator.
* [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html "LFO CHOP") - Add vibrato or LFO.
* [Noise CHOP](Noise_CHOP.html "Noise CHOP") - Generate white noise.
* [Audio Band EQ CHOP](Audio_Band_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Band EQ CHOP") - Graphic equalizer.
* [Audio Para EQ CHOP](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html "Audio Para EQ CHOP") - Filter, echo, pitch shift.
* [Audio Filter CHOP](Audio_Filter_CHOP.html "Audio Filter CHOP") - Low pass, high pass, band pass filter.
* [Resample CHOP](Resample_CHOP.html "Resample CHOP") - Change the sample rate of a sound.
* [Trigger CHOP](Trigger_CHOP.html "Trigger CHOP") - Make volume envelope with delay, attack, decay, sustain, release.
* [Timer CHOP](Timer_CHOP.html "Timer CHOP") - Cross-dissolve one sound to another.
* [Lag CHOP](Lag_CHOP.html "Lag CHOP") - Make glissando pitch sweeps.
* [Envelope CHOP](Envelope_CHOP.html "Envelope CHOP") - Follow the loudness of a sound.

When you are processing an audio clip by reading the whole file into an [File In CHOP](File_In_CHOP.html "File In CHOP"):

* [Trim CHOP](Trim_CHOP.html "Trim CHOP") - Shorten the audio.
* [Cycle CHOP](Cycle_CHOP.html "Cycle CHOP") - Make it repeat.
* [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP") - Add vibrato or LFO.
* [Shift CHOP](Shift_CHOP.html "Shift CHOP") - Re-time the sounds, simple echo, delay.
* [Stretch CHOP](Stretch_CHOP.html "Stretch CHOP") - Make a sound slower or faster, but shifting pitch too.
* [Copy CHOP](Copy_CHOP.html "Copy CHOP") - Use triggers to copy sounds along a timeline.
* [Pulse CHOP](Pulse_CHOP.html "Pulse CHOP") - Time pulses to produce rhythms as a sequencer.
* [Composite CHOP](Composite_CHOP.html "Composite CHOP") - Layer one sound over a longer sound.
* [Lookup CHOP](Lookup_CHOP.html "Lookup CHOP") - Soft limit amplitudes etc.

## 3D Audio[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Creating_Audio_with_CHOPs&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: 3D Audio")]

CHOPs can take events from a 3D scene, imported through the [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") or [Object CHOP](Object_CHOP.html "Object CHOP"), and be used to trigger sounds and control the placement of sounds in 3D space.

An object, particle, or point position in 3D space can be used to set the left-right ear separation, or used as reverb controls which add a cue that simulates proximity of the sound.

Audio can be generated for offscreen objects, adding more 3D cues and realism.

# Cube Map TOP

The Cube Map TOP builds a texture map in the [Cube Map](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cube_Map "Cube Map") internal texture format. It accepts a vertical cross image, or 1 input per side of the cube. The [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT") can use the cube maps from the Cube Map TOP for reflections. The [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") can also create cube maps. You can sample a cube map in a GLSL shader by declaring them like this

```
uniform samplerCube <name>;

and sampling them using this in GLSL 3.30+

```
texture(samplerCube name, vec3 texcoords)

or this in GLSL 1.20

```
textureCube(samplerCube name, vec3 texcoords)

Curveclay SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Curveclay SOP

The Curveclay SOP is similar to the Clay SOP in that you deform a spline surface not by modifying the CVs but by directly manipulating the surface. However, instead of using a point on the surface, you use one or more faces to deform that surface. Also, CurveClay does not yet support polygonal meshes.

The combination of inputs will determine the modes of transformation. For any combination of inputs, the following parameters modify the following behaviors of the SOP.

* [2 Parameters - Curve Clay Page](#Parameters_-_Curve_Clay_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Projection Page](#Parameters_-_Projection_Page)
* [4 Parameters - Displacement Page](#Parameters_-_Displacement_Page)
* [5 Notes](#Notes)

* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Curve Clay Page

Face Group `facegroup` - Subset of faces (NURBS, Bézier, Polygons) to project, or subset of proles to deform, depending on how many inputs are connected.

Examples include: 0.5 1.2-3.9 5.\*

This group can even take surfaces (possibly intermixed with profile curves) when the 2nd input is not present, indicating that all the surface’s proles must be used.

Then, the example above becomes: 0.5 1.2-3.9 5

Surface Group `surfgroup` - Subset of spline surfaces to be deformed when all three SOP inputs are connected.
Divisions on Face `divs` - The number of points to evaluate on the proles or the faces. This SOP works by using a straight line approximation of the given curve to deform the surface. Thus, more segments are slower, but the result looks better. Fewer divisions need to be specified when deforming proles and when the rest and deforming faces have an equal number of breakpoints.
Sharpness `sharp` - Species the area around the face to deform. The larger the sharpness is, the smaller the deformation area around them (thus having a sharper pull on the surface).
Refinement `refine` - Usually, CurveClay automatically renes the surface. However, you may specify some degree of renement control. In general, the more rened the surface is, the smoother the result. Better renement results in a denser surface. You should experiment with values between -1 and 1. When the value is negative, the SOP will rst rene the surface to the same detail level as when renement is 0, and then it unrenes it. The lower the value, the more unrened it becomes.

## Parameters - Projection Page

Controls curve projection. Enabled if all 3 inputs exist.

Projection Axis `projop` - ⊞ - Choice of several projection axes:

* X `xaxis` - Cartesian Axis - X, Y, or Z.

* Y `yaxis` - Cartesian Axis - X, Y, or Z.

* Z `zaxis` - Cartesian Axis - X, Y, or Z.

* Minimum Distance `mindist` - Project curve points to their closest places on surface.

* User Defined: `other` - Enter Vector into the field below.

`projdir` - ⊞ - Specify the direction vector of the projection.

* `projdir1` -

* `projdir2` -

* `projdir3` -

## Parameters - Displacement Page

How to deform surface. Enabled if only 1 input exists.

Displacement Axis `deformop` - ⊞ - Choice of several projection axes:

* Surface Normal `snormal` - The proles will be deformed along the surface normal.

* X `xaxis` - Cartesian axis - X, Y, or Z.

* Y `yaxis` - Cartesian axis - X, Y, or Z.

* Z `zaxis` - Cartesian axis - X, Y, or Z.

* User Defined: `other` - Enter the vector into the eld below.

`deformdir` - ⊞ - Specify the direction vector of the displacement.

* `deformdir1` -

* `deformdir2` -

* `deformdir3` -

Distance `deformlen` - Distance deformed along the vector.
Deform Inside of Loop `deforminside` - Check if the inside of closed loops should be deformed.
Consider Profiles Individually `individual` - Check if multiple curves form a closed loop.

When using CurveClay on a wrapped surface, here are some points to remember:

* You may want to use a higher number of divisions, since when going across the seam of the wrapped surface, straight line approximation would be turned off and more sample points may be needed.
* If you’re not going across the seam, then the reﬁnement of the surface is only local. However, when the deformation area of the surface gets near the seam, the reﬁnement is done over the whole surface. Do not be alarmed if the whole surface has been reﬁned.

## Parameters - Curvesect Page

Face Group `leftgroup` - A subset of faces (NURBS, Bzier, polygons) to act upon. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Cutter Group `rightgroup` - A subset of faces or spline surfaces to intersect with. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Find All Intersections `xsect` - Compute intersection points if the faces touch the cutter primitive. If the button is unchecked, only the point of minimum distance will be found. Currently, finding the minimum distance between a face and a surface is not available.
Tolerance `tolerance` - Determines the precision of the intersection.
Method `method` - ⊞ - Choose between 'Cut' or 'Extract' operations.

* Cut `cut` -

* Extract `extract` -

Left Face Pieces `left` - ⊞ - Choose what parts of the left faces to keep:

* Keep All `lkeepall` - All the face segments generated by the intersection(s).

* Keep Odd-numbered Ones `lkeepodd` - The odd face segments: 1, 3, 5...

* Keep Even-numbered Ones `lkeepeven` - The even face segments: 0, 2, 4...

* Keep None `lkeepnone` - Delete the entire face.

Right Face Pieces `right` - ⊞ - Choose what parts of the right faces to keep:

* Keep None `rkeepnone` - Delete the entire face.

Affect `affect` - ⊞ - Choose which input to operate on:

* Left Input `left` - Extract from the left input faces.

* Right Input `right` - Extract from the right input (face or surface).

* Both Inputs `both` - Extract from both left and right inputs.

Extract Point `extractpt` - If the right input is a surface, choose between point and isoparm extraction; only points are extracted if the right input is a face.
Keep Original `keeporiginal` - When using Extract method, turning this on will keep the original geometry connected to the first input (input0).

[![TouchGeometry239.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/f/f3/TouchGeometry239.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry239.gif)

### Circles

1. Place two NURBS Circle SOPs, one of them slightly offset in X and Y (not Z).
2. Pipe their outputs into a Curvesect SOP, make it the display SOP.
3. Method: Cut. For the Left Face, select Keep Odd-numbered Ones.
4. You can extract the inside (even) or outside (odd) portion of the curve where they intersect.

### Star

1. Model a closed NURBS curve in the shape of a star (use a Model SOP).
2. Place a NURBS Circle SOP.
3. Pipe them into a Curvesect SOP, make it the display SOP.
4. It produces five independent NURBS curves based on their intersection with the NURBS circle.
5. You could append a Join SOP to reconnect the individual NURBS curves into a new continuous curve. It smoothly connects the remaining segments.

### Creeping behaviour along a Path

1. Place a new Font SOP and then a Circle SOP. Circle SOP - Type: NURBS, Radius 0.1, 0.1; Centre -3, 0.3, 0.2. Font SOP - Text: "Creep Along Me".
2. Append a Curvesect SOP with the Font and Circle SOPs feeding into the first and second inputs respectively. Change the Tolerance to `1.0`, and enable the Extract operation. Turn off Find All Intersections. Make it the display SOP.
3. Enable the template flags on the Font and Circle SOPs (use S click).
4. Home the view, and enable the Point display in the Viewport options.
5. As you change the Circle's X value from -3.0 to 3.0, you will notice that a number of points will creep along the paths of the curves within the text. Using a Copy SOP to copy geometry to each of these points gives you a simple way of creating an irregular "flocking behaviour" along predetermined paths. This works, because as the circle moves above the curves in the text, the points in the curves that are closest to the circle move also.
6. Use a Model SOP instead of a Font SOP to model several NURBS curves which are the paths to follow for more precise control over the motion.

Cycle CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Cycle CHOP

The Cycle CHOP creates cycles. It can repeat the channels any number of times before and after the original. It can also make a single cycle have a smooth transition from its end to its beginning, so it loops smoothly.

Since channels may not naturally loop well, the Cycle CHOP provides three different methods of blending between the cycles.

* [5 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [6 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [6.1 Common CHOP Info Channels](#Common_CHOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Cycle Page

Cycles Before `before` - The number of cycles to loop before the input CHOP. This parameter can be fractional.
Cycles After `after` - The number of cycles to loop after the input CHOP. This parameter can be fractional.
Mirror Cycles `mirror` - If enabled, consecutive cycles are mirror images (reversed) of each another. The first cycle is never mirrored.
Blend Start to End `extremes` - If on, the end of the CHOP is blended into the start of the CHOP to produce a smooth loop. If Cycles Before and Cycles After are 0, Region is non-zero, and Extend Conditions are "Cycle", it loops smoothly forever.

Method `blendmethod` - ⊞ - How to blend between cycles:

* Preserve Length `pre` - Keeps the total length of each cycle the same as the length of the input CHOP.

* Overlap Sequences `ovl` - Overlaps each cycle with the previous cycle.

* Insert Blend Region `ins` - Inserts a region between the cycles where blending is done.

Shape `blendfunc` - ⊞ - The shape of the blending function:

* Linear `lin` - Linear blend.

* Ease in `ei` - Uses an easein() function for blending.

* Ease out `eo` - Uses an easeout() function for blending.

* Ease in Ease out `cos` - Uses both easein() and easeout() functions.

* Cubic `cub` - For Insert Blend Region, uses a cubic() interpolation to fill the region between the cycles.

* Add `add` - The overlapped regions have the overlapping samples simply added. This is suitable for looping audio.

Region `blendregion` - The size of the blend region, in either seconds, samples or frames (set with Units in the Common page).
Blend Region Units `blendregionunit` -
Bias `blendbias` - The bias of the blend. A -1 biases the blend toward the beginning of the blend region, 0 is no bias and +1 biases towards the end of the blend region.
Step `step` - If set to 1, the next cycle will be shifted up or down in value, so that it begins where the last cycle ended. Suitable for the root object of walk cycles.
Step Scope `stepscope` - The names of those channels that will be affected by the Step parameter.

Extra Information for the Cycle CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

DAT - Derivative

# DAT

[![OP DAT.png](images/thumb/c/c5/OP_DAT.png/1000px-OP_DAT.png)](File_OP_DAT.html)

See also [Category:DATs](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Category:DATs&action=edit&redlink=1 "Category:DATs (page does not exist)") for a full list of articles related to DATs.

**DATa Operators** (or **DATs**) are used to hold text data like strings, scripts, and XML. DATs either contain multiple lines of text as in a script, or a table of rows and columns of cells, each containing one string. You can edit the contents of the DAT directly in the [DAT Viewer](DAT_Viewer.html "DAT Viewer").

Access a DAT containing normal text using `op('text1').text`. Access a cell in a DAT containing a table using `op('table1')[1,2]` or by row/col names `op('table1')['rowname', 'colname']`.

**IMPORTANT**: `op('table1')[1,2]` is a python [cell object](Cell_Class.html "Cell Class") which usually gets converted for you to the string in the cell. More safely use `op('table1')[1,2].val` which always gives you the string.

## Sweet Sixteen DATs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Sweet Sixteen DATs")]

The following 16 DATs are commonly used, we recommend familiarizing yourself with them.

All DATs are documented in the [Category:DATs](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Category:DATs&action=edit&redlink=1 "Category:DATs (page does not exist)").

## DATs for Scripting[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: DATs for Scripting")]

DATs can be linked together to select, re-arrange and evaluate data and expressions, making DATs a powerful **procedural scripting tool**.

DATs that contain scripts can be triggered by events like mouse clicks and any operation of gadgets in TouchDesigner control panels. DAT scripts can also be triggered by channel changes in CHOPs.

**Script Example**: This will create a button that plays a sound when you click it: Create a Button component (Tab -> COMP -> Button). Go inside it (Enter) and create an Audio Play CHOP (Tab -> CHOP -> Audio Play).Then create a Panel Execute DAT (Tab -> DAT -> Panel Execute) and make its [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active"). Then click in its viewer and and change the `offToOn()` function to be:
```
def offToOn(panelValue):
     op('audioplay1').par.trigger.pulse()
     return

Click outside the node to end text entry. Go back up (u), make the button a Momentary button via its Button page and Button Type parameter. Then make the button [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active"). Click on the viewer of the button. It should make a Notify sound.

You can also run a script in a Text DAT by using the "`run`" command from the textport or another DAT.

## DATs for Tables[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: DATs for Tables")]

DAT tables are rows and columns of cells containing text strings.

The DAT whose name is [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") is used to define new tables. To manually add, delete rows and columns of tables, press RMB over the table when [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active") is on and select from the menu.

The tables are then manipulated by the [Select DAT](Select_DAT.html "Select DAT"), [Evaluate DAT](Evaluate_DAT.html "Evaluate DAT"), [Merge DAT](Merge_DAT.html "Merge DAT"), [Switch DAT](Switch_DAT.html "Switch DAT"), [Sort DAT](Sort_DAT.html "Sort DAT") and others.

You can use table DATs to export to parameters. See [DAT Export](DAT_Export.html "DAT Export").

DAT tables can be modified with the `tabcell` command.

Table cells are read with a `tab()`, `tabr()`, `tabc()` or `tabrc()` expression. See Help -> Commands and Expressions.

**Table Example**: This will create two TOP images with names in it: Create a Table DAT (Tab -> DAT -> Table). Make its [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active"). Right-click on the viewer and select Add Column, and then Add Row, and again Add Row, which should give you 3 rows and 2 columns of empty cells (or put 2 and 3 in the parameters.)Click in the top left cell and type `name`, top right type `age`, and fill in the remaining cells with `joe`, `9`, `jane`, `21`.Now create a Text TOP (Tab -> TOP -> Text) and in its parameter called Text, type this expression to retrieve a cell from the table: ``tabc("table1", $OD, "name")``. You should see "joe" in the Text TOP viewer. Copy/paste the Text TOP (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V). The new TOP should be called `text2` and its viewer should say "jane".That `tabc()` expression gets from the table, `table1`, the node you edited. It gets from the column called `name`. And the row is `$OD`, which is a variable you can use in any node that means "operator digits", the digits at the end of the operator name, which in this case is `1` and `2` for `text1` and `text2`.In the TOPs' expressions, you can replace `"name"` with `"age"`.

## DATs for manipulating Web and XML Data[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: DATs for manipulating Web and XML Data")]

The [Web Client DAT](Web_Client_DAT.html "Web Client DAT") gets HTML or other data by passing a URL to the internet and receiving a response. The result and any XML data can be filtered with an [XML DAT](XML_DAT.html "XML DAT"), then further processed with the other DATs.

## DATs for Raw Text[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: DATs for Raw Text")]

DATs can also be use to hold raw text which can then used by the [Text TOP](Text_TOP.html "Text TOP") and [Text SOP](Text_SOP.html "Text SOP") for use in compositing and 3D. They can also be used to leave comments your networks or for pop-up help messages for panel gadgets.

## Editing DATs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Editing DATs")]

DATs can be edited directly in their viewers by turning on the [Viewer Active Flag](Viewer_Active_Flag.html "Viewer Active Flag").

You can also edit DATs in the [Textport](Textport.html "Textport") by right-clicking on a DAT and selecting **Edit Contents in Textport**.

Some DAT generators and most DAT filters can not be edited because their data is fed to them from their input. This is indicated in the viewer by a more muted text color compared to those DATs which can be edited. If you need to temporarily edit the contents of one of these DATs you can lock the DAT using the [Lock Flag](Lock_Flag.html "Lock Flag") and then edit it. However, these changes will be lost when the DAT is unlocked and locking it keeps it from [cooking](Cook.html "Cook"), so this is generally only useful for troubleshooting and debugging.

By default, text-type DATs display line numbers in the left margin area and table-type DATs display row and column numbers. The display of these numbers can be controlled in [Preferences](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Preferences_Dialog&action=edit&redlink=1 "Preferences Dialog (page does not exist)").

## Editing DAT Text in an External Editor[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Editing DAT Text in an External Editor")]

In any DAT (or any parameter), if you right-click the DAT node and select **Edit Contents...** you will be editing the text in an external editor. Notepad is Windows default text editor.

To change the text editor to something else, like Notepad++, Vim, Sublime, etc. you need to change the Text Editor and Table Editor preference values. These preferences can be found in the Preferences dialog under the DATs page. Set their values to the path of the installed application executable (.exe) of the editor you want to use. For example, `C:/Program Files ..`.

Everyone has a favorite, have a look at Sublime Text 2.

To see how you set an environment variable, see [Variables](Variables.html "Variables").

## Using DATs[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=DAT&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Using DATs")]

* text data, text and table formats (tab delimited)
* use for scripts, commands, storage of values and arrays
* can be edited in the viewer, textport, or any external text editor
* Import: Text DAT, Table DAT, Web DAT
* Export: (right-click to save)

A form of DATs (Data Operators) that is structured as rows and columns of text strings.

The dialog box in which commands and scripts can typed in manually. Output to the textport includes script errors and messages from `print()` and `debug()` calls in python code. You can also edit DATs in the textport.

### Modifying Text Content[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Modifying Text Content")]

When the DAT is not a table, but a block of text, its contents can be simply accessed through its text member.

```
t = op('merge1').text
op('text2').text = 'merge1 contains:' + t

op('text3').text = "Hello there!"

### Modifying a Single Cell of a Table[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Modifying a Single Cell of a Table")]

Using `DAT[row, column]` where *`row, column`* specifies which cell to modify. The row and column may be integer numbers starting at 0, or strings which are the column names or row names (in row 0 or column 0 respectively):

```
op('table1')['Monday',1] = 'day1'

tab = op('table1')
tab[0,0] = 'corner'
tab[1,'select'] = 'yes'
tab['Monday',1] = 'day1'

# DAT Execute DAT

The DAT Execute DAT monitors another DAT's contents and runs a script when those contents change. The other DAT is usually a table.

DAT Execute DATs are created with [default python method placeholders](https://docs.derivative.ca/DatexecuteDAT_Class#Callbacks "DatexecuteDAT Class"). For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[datexecuteDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/DatexecuteDAT_Class "DatexecuteDAT Class")

## Parameters - DAT Execute Page

* Specified Operator `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

From Operator `fromop` - The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to *Specified Operator*.
DAT `dat` - The DAT which is monitored and will trigger the script to execute when its contents change.
Table Change `tablechange` - The onTableChange() method is called if the table changes in any way since the last cook.
Row Change `rowchange` - The onRowChange() method is called once for every row that changed (since its last cook).
Column Change `colchange` - The onColChange() method is called once for every column that changed (since its last cook).
Cell Change `cellchange` - The onCellChange() method is called for every cell that changed since the last cook.
Size Change `sizechange` - The onSizeChange() method is called for every table size change since the last cook.
Execute `execute` - ⊞ - Determines if the methods are executed at the start of the frame or end of the frame.

* Start of Frame `start` - The method will be called from the start of the frame. If a row changes 4 times during a frame then the method will run 4 times as well (useful for [Multi Touch In DAT](Multi_Touch_In_DAT.html "Multi Touch In DAT") events for example).

* End of Frame `end` - The method will execute at most one time per frame, at the end of the frame, even if it triggered several times in one frame. If, for example, Monitor is set to Row, a row may change several times in a frame, but it will be called only once for each row.

Extra Information for the DAT Execute DAT can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

DAT Export - Derivative

# DAT Export

DAT exporting sends numbers, strings or expressions in a table format to a [parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter") of any [operator](Operator.html "Operator").

To export data from a DAT, the green Export flag at the bottom of the DAT must be on, AND the DAT must be in a table format with properly named columns.
The columns are named:

`path parameter value enable`

Each row represents one value to be exported to a parameter of another node.

The `path` and `parameter` specify the network path to the operator and parameter where the data will be exported to.

The `value` column contains the data to be exported. It can be a numeric value, string value or expression.

The `enable` column is optional. When set to '0' the export in that row is disabled, when set to '1' the export is enabled.

The DAT's green [Export Flag](Export_Flag.html "Export Flag") must be On to enable the export.
Once the export is established, a dotted data [link](Link.html "Link") will connect the DAT and the operator to indicate a connection.

To disable the export, simply toggle the DAT's export flag off.

[![DATexport.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/6/60/DATexport.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:DATexport.png)

By default, the [Python](Python.html "Python") expression is re.match('.\*',me.inputCell.val) != None. '.\*' means match any character multiple times, so this expression matches all values. If you want to match the parent's operator name followed by any numeric number you can use parent().name+'[0-9]\*', where '[0-9]\*' matches any numerical string. '.\*'+parent().name+'.\*' will match any cell that contains the operator's parent name. You can check [Regular Expression Operations](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/re.html) for additional information on how to use the Python Regular Expression module.

DAT to SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# DAT to SOP

The DAT to SOP can be used to create geometry from DAT tables, or if a SOP input is specified, to modify attributes on existing geometry. See also the [Add SOP](Add_SOP.html "Add SOP").

Without a SOP input, the output is created entirely from the DAT, one SOP point per row of the DAT, except for an optional top row with column headings. The common columns headings include the point number `index`, point position `P(0) P(1) P(2)`, point weight `Pw`, the color and alpha `Cd(0) Cd(1) Cd(2) Cd(3)`, texture coordinates `uv(0) uv(1) uv(2)`, and point normal `N(0) N(1) N(2)`. If no index column is specified, row number is used as the point number. If there is no heading for the Point DAT, the list of attributes is assumed to be in order `P(0) P(1) P(2) Pw Cd(0) Cd(1) Cd(2) Cd(3) N(0) N(1) N(2) uv(0) uv(1) uv(2)` for the first 14 columns.
If an input is used, attributes are read in and replace the ones in the existing geometry. The Merge parameter will be enabled when an input is connected. Depending on the Merge menu setting, either the Points DAT or Primitive DAT parameter used for the merge data. If an input is used, the Points or Primitives DAT must have a column named `index`. This column is used to match the point or primitive to the incoming geometry by point or primitive number.
Attributes in the columns headings should have column name *`attrib`* if it is a single value attribute, or have multiple columns named `attrib(0)`, `attrib(1)`, `attrib(2)` etc if it is a multiple-value attribute.
Data can also be converted into a form that can be rendered as particles.

DAT Viewer - Derivative

# DAT Viewer

[![DATViewer.jpg](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/0/05/DATViewer.jpg)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:DATViewer.jpg)

A DAT viewer displays the text data in a DAT. This can be displayed in 2 ways, in raw text for standard format text or in a spreadsheet format when the DAT holds **table** formatted text.

If the DAT is editable, the text can be edited directly in the DAT viewer. Editable text is displayed in blue. Non-editable text is displayed in purple, DATs which get their data via the node's input are non-editable.

Ctrl+g will reset the text to the **Preferred Text Size** set in [Preferences](Dialogs_Preferences_Dialog.html "Dialogs:Preferences Dialog").
Ctrl+h will attempt to fit the entire body of text in the available viewer size. Scaling down text size to fit the viewer is limited by the **Minimum Text Size** set in [Preferences](Dialogs_Preferences_Dialog.html "Dialogs:Preferences Dialog").
If the text is non-editable, g and h can be used without holding down the ctrl key.

Deform SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Deform SOP

The Deform SOP takes geometry along with point weights (assigned by the [Capture SOP](Capture_SOP.html "Capture SOP")) and deforms geometry as Capture Regions are moved. This gives you the flexibility to procedurally modify geometry between the Capture and Deform SOPs.

See also [Deforming Geometry (Skinning)](Deforming_Geometry_(Skinning).html "Deforming Geometry (Skinning)").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[deformSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/DeformSOP_Class "DeformSOP Class")

Group `group` - Optional point and/or primitive group to be deformed. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Delete Capture Attributes `delcaptatr` - The point capture attributes can significantly increase the memory usage of the geometry. This option will delete the point capture attributes after it deforms the geometry in order to save memory for any subsequent SOPs.
Delete Point Colors `delcolatr` - You may find that you are using point coloring from the Capture SOP to assist in the capturing process. If you do not need these point colors after the Deform SOP, you can turn this parameter on to delete the colors.
Deform Normals `donormal` - Turn this on to deform the normals as the geometry deforms.
Skeleton Root Path `skelrootpath` - Specify the path to the root of the skeleton.

Delete CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Delete CHOP

The Delete CHOP removes entire channels and/or individual samples of its input.

For deleting channels, on the Channels page, you can specify which channels to delete by channel name or a channel number range. A second method deletes channels using a value range to select channels whose values are all within a range. The third method deletes constant-valued channels. An option selects whether to delete or retain the matched channels.

For deleting individual samples (i.e. no channels are deleted), on the Samples page you can delete, for example, only the samples whose value is below 0, which will shorten the length of the CHOP.

In CHOPs with two or more channels, one or more "compare" channels are used to determine which samples are to be deleted. By default it uses the first channel to compare against. Deleting a sample at a certain index deletes a value for all the channels. If there are 4 channels, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `alpha` and you specify `alpha` as the "compare" channel, you can delete all the samples with an `alpha` of `0`. If a CHOP is 3 channels with an X,Y,Z position, you can delete all samples where the XYZ length is below a threshold.

This is useful, for example, for thinning your data before sending a CHOP to a Geometry component for instancing.

When all the samples are deleted, the CHOP will keep one sample for all channels and will have a `length` of one sample. When this happens, if you have an Info CHOP attached to the Delete CHOP, it's

The primary axis and the spread angle from the defined axis define a range of angles. If any entity normals lie within this range, then the associated entity is selected.

**For example**; if you want to select the polygons that are very steep in a polygon mountain terrain on the XZ axis. You would set the Direction to be `0, 1, 0` and the spread angle to around 75. This selects all the polygons with normals that lie flat to fairly sloped. You will have grouped all of the polygons that lie flat up to polys that are at a 75 angle from the axis. You are left with all of the polygons that are 76 or greater.

Direction `dir` - ⊞ - The default values of `0, 1, 0` create a normal vector straight up in Y, which is perpendicular to the XZ plane, which becomes the primary axis. The `1, 0, 0` points the normal in positive X, giving a normal axis perpendicular to the YZ. The plane may be positioned at an angle by using values typed in (`1, 1, 0` gives a 45 angle plane) or interactively by using the direction vector jack. Values between 0 and 1 should be used.

Spread Angle `angle` - The value entered in this field generates an angle of deviation from the primary axis. This can be visualized as a cone where the radius of the base of the cone is defined by the Spread Angle and the axis of the cone is determined by the Direction axis. Viewing the primitive normals in the viewport, you can see that any primitives with normals that have an angle that lies in the range of angles defined by the cone will be selected and grouped.
Backface from `camera` - This menu allows you to select an object. Typically, a camera object would be chosen. The primitives which are backface when viewed from the object specified will be grouped or selected.

Delete Unused Groups `removegrp` - If any group has 0 entries and if this parameter is enabled, then those groups are removed. If you want to keep empty groups, disable this parameter.
Delete Geometry, Keep Points `keeppoints` - Deletes the geometry but keeps the points.

Dependency Class - Derivative

# Dependency Class

A **[Dependency](Dependency.html "Dependency")** object is a value that automatically causes any expression referencing it to update when the dependency value has changed. These objects eliminate the need to manually force cook operators referencing values in [Extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions") or [Storage](OP_Class.html#Storage "OP Class") for example.
For information about dependencies in mutable objects (lists, dicts, sets), see **[Deeply Dependable Collections](TDStoreTools.html#Deeply_Dependable_Collections "TDStoreTools")**

`val` → `Any` :

> The value associated with this object. Referencing this value in an expression will cause the operator to become dependent on its value. Setting this value will cause those operators to be recooked as necessary.

`peekVal` → `Any` **(Read Only)**:

> This returns the same value as .val but does not create a dependency on the value.

`callbacks` → `list` :

> A modifiable list of functions. When the Dependency object is modified, it calls each function on the list. Each function is called with a single argument which is a dictionary containing the following:
> 
> * 'dependency'- The Dependency that was modified.
> * 'prevVal' - The previous value if available.
> * 'callback' - This callback function.

`ops` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> A list of [operators](OP_Class.html "OP Class") currently dependent on the object.

`listAttributes` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> A list of [list attributes](ListAttribute_Class.html "ListAttribute Class") currently dependent on the object.

`modified()`→ `None`:

> This call is needed when changing not the value itself, but a subcomponent. For example, if Dependency.val is a dictionary, setting any of the members will not notify the dependent operators. A call to modified is necessary.

`setVal(val, setInfo=None)`→ `None`:

> Sets the value with optional information.
> 
> * val - The new value to be set.
> * setInfo (Keyword, Optional) - Optional information passed to the modified callback.

`[<index or key>]`→ `collection value`:

> **Only when the dependency wraps iterable or mapped data such as a list or dictionary**, you can use [] to access the items in the wrapped data.
> 
> ```
> dep = tdu.Dependency({'fred': 33, 'wilma':39})
> print(dep['fred']) # prints "33". The key to the dictionary works directly on the dependency object.
> dep2 = tdu.Dependency(["a", "d", "g"])
> print(dep[2]) # prints "g". The index to the list works directly on the dependency object.
> 
> ```

### Usage[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Usage")]

Consider the following module, used as an [extension](Extensions.html "Extensions") in a component called `comp1` for example

```
class MyClass:
	def __init__(self):
		self.Scale = 5

Any expressions that reference `Scale` will not update when `Scale` is manually changed. For example, if either of these expressions was in the value field of a Constant CHOP, it would not be updated if the `Scale` value was updated.

# using a non-promoted extension
op('comp1').ext.MyClass.Scale

# using a promoted extension
op('comp1').Scale

If you need your references to dynamically update, you can create a `Dependency`. Start by defining a `tdu.Dependency` as below:

```
class MyClass:
	def __init__(self):
		self.Scale = tdu.Dependency(5)

Now there is a cook dependency created between the `Scale` value, and the Operator referencing it. There are two ways to reference the value. The first is similar to how we were referencing the value previous:

and the other method is to explicitly call the `Scale`'s `val`:

# use for non-promoted extension
op('comp1').ext.MyClass.Scale.val

# use for a promoted extension
op('comp1').Scale.val

Note the `.val` is often not required, as the Dependency object will cast itself to its underlying value in most cases.

To update this value, you must reference the member's `val`. A `Dependency` value is a type in and of itself and writing the expression below would actually overwrite the `Dependency` value with a regular interger and remove the cook dependency from the references:

# wrong way to update dependency of a promoted extension
op('comp1').Scale = 5

What you should do instead is assign the value to the `val` of the `Dependency` as below:

# correct way to update dependency of a promoted extension
op('comp1').Scale.val = 5

Using this method will update the value of `Scale` while keeping the `Dependency` intact.

Dictionaries, lists, sets, and other objects with changing contents are called "mutable" objects. **If the contents of a mutable object changes, a dependency wrapping it does not automatically register as being modified!** You must either use a **[deeply dependable collection](TDStoreTools.html#Deeply_Dependable_Collections "TDStoreTools")** or call the `.modified()` function manually as in the example below:

```
op('comp1').Scale.val = [1,2,3]
op('comp1').Scale.val[1] = 15 # changing the contents doesn't update dependency!
op('comp1').Scale.modified() # this call notifies TouchDesigner that the value has changed

You can create Python callbacks that are called when the dependency object changes:

```
op('comp1').Scale.callbacks = [print]

# adding a function requires getting the list, changing it, then re-setting it
def prevPrint(info):
	print(f'Previous value: {info['prevVal']})
    
callbacks = op('comp1').Scale.callbacks
callbacks.append(prevPrint)
op('comp1').Scale.callbacks = callbacks

# removing a callback works similarly
callbacks = op('comp1').Scale.callbacks
callbacks.remove(print)
op('comp1').Scale.callbacks = callbacks

is the [Procedural](Procedural.html "Procedural") mechanism in TouchDesigner, where if one piece of data changes, it automatically causes other operators and expressions to re-[Cook](Cook.html "Cook").

Depth TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Depth TOP

The Depth TOP reads an image containing depth information from a scene described in a specified [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). The resulting image is black (0) at pixels where the surface is at the near depth value (Camera's parameter "Near"). It is white (1) at pixels where the surface is at the far depth value (parameter "Far").

The Depth TOP is used to do shadow mapping. It can have many other uses also, such as edge detection based on depth.

The depth range is by definition the near plane -> far plane. Values in the Depth TOP will be 0 at the near plane, and 1 at the far plane. Generally the image in the Depth TOP will be white, unless you have your planes really tight around your object. But just because you can't visually see anything, it doesn't mean the information isn't there.

Another option is Linear Camera-Space Depth. If the Render TOP's Depth Buffer Format is set to 32-Bit Floating-Point and its Linear Camera-Space Depth parameter is on, then the Depth TOP will output linear camera space depth.

You can use the [Level TOP](Level_TOP.html "Level TOP") to re-range the Depth TOP's values. However make sure you set the Pixel Format of the Level TOP to 16 or 32-bit, or you'll lose a lot of information from the Depth TOP's data (The Depth TOP has 24-bit data).

The Depth TOP creates a 24-bit fixed-point or 32-bit floating-point single channel image. When the Depth TOP is used as an input to another TOP, its data will be treated like an RGBA value of (D, D, D, 1). The same is true when sampling a depth texture in a GLSL shader.

Direct Display Out TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Direct Display Out TOP

The Direct Display Out TOP uses new technology available in [Vulkan](Vulkan.html "Vulkan") which allows directly outputting the DisplayPort/HDMI ports on the GPU, without interacting with the Windows Desktop. This avoids the need for a Window COMP, avoids cases where other windows and the mouse cursor will go in front of the content window, and avoids a lot of the issues caused by the Windows Compositor, as described [Perfect Playback](Perfect_Playback.html "Perfect Playback"). Up to 3 outputs can be controlled via Direct Display.

Requirements:

* A TouchDesigner Educational, Commercial or Pro license.
* Workstation Nvidia GPU (Nvidia RTX/Quadro). Geforce will not be able to remove displays from the desktop using configureDdisplay.exe.
* Windows 11 Pro For Workstations or Windows 11 Enterprise version. Needed to remove the output from the desktop.

Once the above requirements are met, the next step is to setup the outputs. If using indiviual outputs, you can setup the resolution/refresh rate in the Nvidia Control Panel.

To sync up multiple outputs on a single machine, use the [configureMosaic.exe tool from Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/mosaic-utility/) or the Nvidia Control Panel first to setup your Mosaic configuration. Make sure the resolution/refresh rate of the display is what is desired.

Next remove the display(s) from the desktop so they can be directly controlled by Direct Display. This must be done using [configureDdisplay.exe tool from Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/ddisplay-utility/).

For example you can list the monitors using

```
 configureDdisplay status

and then remove monitor index 1 using

```
 configureDdisplay remove-from-desktop -i 1

If you want to use Quadro Sync/Hardware Frame Lock, use the [QSync Utility](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/qsync-utility/) to configure that now.
Quadro Sync [Hardware Frame Lock](Hardware_Frame_Lock.html "Hardware Frame Lock") is supported in Pro versions, allowing multiple GPUs to output in sync across multiple TouchDesigner instances.

Once this is all done, the Direct Display Out TOP will be able to find and output to the outputs.

Some additional information can be found in [this talk](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtc24-s62208/) starting at 32:42. Or on page 72 in the .pdf attached to the talk.

Displace TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Displace TOP

The Displace TOP will cause one image to be warped by another image. A pixel of the output image at (Uo,Vo) gets its RGBA value from a different pixel (Ui, Vi) of the Source Image by using the second input image (the Displace Image).

For each pixel in the output image, three factors affect which pixel to fetch from the source:

* The horizontal and vertical source channels of the Displace Image (Red and Blue by default).
* the Uo and Vo coordinate of the output pixel.
* A constant Ua and Va anchor point (Offset).

**Displace Image** - In using the Displace Image, for each pixel in the output, it gets the corresponding pixel from the input, and uses the red channel and blue channel as its U and V displacement. If the red and blue are .5, .5, then Uo = Ui and Vo = Vi. That is, there is no warp if the Displace Image is a 50% grey. Also the warp is reduced to 0 if the Displace Weight is 0. Where red < .5 in the Displace Image, it fetches a pixel from the left of Uo in the Source Image. If blue < .5, it fetches a pixel from below Vo in the Source Image. Thus the pixel is retrieved from Ui, Vi at Uo\*Scale\*(red-.5), Vo\*Scale\*(.5-blue) of the Source Image.

**Uo and Vo offset** - By default, the warping of each output pixel is relative to its Uo, Vo. But when the UV Weight parameter is 0, the displacement is relative to the center pixel of the Source Image.

**Ua and Va anchor (offset) point** - This zooms into a pixel of the input if you bring the two other weights down to 0.

For the Displace Image, you can change which of its RGBA channels cause the warp.

You can choose if there is wraparound in the image warping. If the computed Uo and Vo is less than 0 or greater than 1, it can wraparound, clamp or mirror.

The Displace Image can be any photograph followed by a Slope TOP, which will give luminance gradients in red and blue, with the neutral value at .5, exactly the form required by the Displace TOP.

One way to experiment is to make a Displace Image from Ramp TOPs. Alternately use a Constant TOP set to .5, .5, .5, 1, then subtract a photo using a Subtract TOP, and add another photo image using an Add TOP. Before subtracting and adding the images, you can lower their effect using Level TOPs and adjusting Brightness.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[displaceTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/DisplaceTOP_Class "DisplaceTOP Class")

## Parameters - Displace Page

Horizontal Source `horzsource` - ⊞ - Instead of using the Red channel to displace horizontally, you can choose a different channel.

Vertical Source `vertsource` - ⊞ - Instead of using the Blue channel to displace vertically, you can choose a different channel.

Source Midpoint `midpoint` - ⊞ - This value is the color values that will result in no displacement. Values below this will cause the displacement to come from the left/bottom of the pixel, while values above this will cause the displacement to come from the right/top of the pixel.

* `midpoint1` -

* `midpoint2` -

Displace Weight `displaceweight` - ⊞ - This scales the offset caused by the Displace Image. It will cause the pixels fetched to be closer/farther along the sample vector created by the Horizontal and Vertical Source.

* `displaceweight1` -

* `displaceweight2` -

UV Weight `uvweight` - This reduces the influence of the pixel's position when brought toward 0. At its default of 1, it doesn't zoom into the Displace Image. When 0, it anchors the displacements relative to one pixel in the Source Image defined by the Offset and Offset Weight parameters.
Offset `offset` - ⊞ - The Offset is first multiplied by the Offset Weight. Then it will be added to the coordinates caluclated after looking up into the displacement map. These final coordinates is what will be used to sample from the source image.

* `offsetx` -

* `offsety` -

Offset Weight `offsetweight` - Scales the Offset parameter values. When this is 0 the Offset parameter will have no effect.
Extend `extend` - ⊞ - This parameter determines what happens at the edges of the tiles.

# Divide SOP

The Divide SOP divides incoming polygonal geometry. It will smooth input polygons, dividing polygons, as well as sub-divide input polygons using the Bricker option. Bricker is also useful for polygon faces with more than four edges to chop them up into quads and triangles allowing for proper shading when using deformation tools.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[divideSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/DivideSOP_Class "DivideSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Convex Polygons `convex` - When checked, this option will convex all incoming polygons to the maximum number of sides as specified in the field below. This is useful for reducing the number of sides of polygons that are concave and not shading properly, e.g. to generate triangles from all incoming geometry, check this option and change the Maximum Edges field below to `3`. You will see that all of the polygons are reduced to three sides maximum (triangles).
Maximum Edges `numsides` - Input value determines the maximum number of edges that all of the input polygons will be reduced to if they exceed this number. Sets the maximum number of sides for convexed polygons. There must be at least three sides. Using small numbers in the range of 3-6 gives the best results; the resulting polygons are not so long and thin. If input polygons have fewer edges than specified, no change will be executed on those polygons.
Triangulate Non-Planar `planar` - Triangulates any non-planar polygons.
Smooth Polygons `smooth` - If checked, this feature will divide the polygons which are adjacent to each other and are not flat, as in the corners of a box. The threshold of the smoothing and the amount of polygon divisions that are added are controlled by the fields below.

All incoming geometry must have shared points for Smooth Polygons to work. You may have to pass the geometry through a [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP") > Consolidate Points to achieve this. For example, to create a dice from a box, add a [Box SOP](Box_SOP.html "Box SOP") followed by a Facet SOP> Consolidate Points then through the Divide SOP with Smooth Polygons enabled; set the Weight fields set to: `4,0.5` and the Divisions set to: `2`.

Weight `weight` - ⊞ - Determines the localization effect of the added polygons. You can isolate the divisions to where there are edges in the geometry with values greater than 1 enhancing the edges by smoothing out the angle transitions. Values less than 1 tend to put the divisions in the flatter areas of the source geometry and alter the shape of the geometry considerably by pulling in the edges.

Divisions `divs` - Determine the level of sub-divisions for the Smooth Polygons option. A value of `1` doubles the number of polygons at the corners, a value of `2` will add twice as much sub-division. Values of `3` and greater may add a substantial number of polygons and should be used with care - you can exponentially increase the complexity.
Bricker Polygons `brick` - Selecting this option divides the input polygon geometry into grid-like squares, though the output is not a mesh. Brickering creates new polygons. It can be used to divide a surface so that it deforms more naturally when wrapped on another surface using a [Creep SOP](Creep_SOP.html "Creep SOP"), or twisted with a [Lattice SOP](Lattice_SOP.html "Lattice SOP").

It can also be used to divide a planar surface into smaller pieces to apply point colors using a [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP"). The size and location of the square divisions created by brickering is determined by the following three options.

Size `size` - ⊞ - Sets the size of the bricker grid divisions in each of the three axes.

# DMX In CHOP

The DMX In CHOP receives channels from DMX, [Art-Net](Art-Net.html "Art-Net"), [sACN](SACN.html "SACN") or KiNET devices. Channel values for DMX are 0-255. Note that input rate is limited to the DMX maximum refresh rate of 44Hz.

A Filter Table can be provided in a DAT where addresses can be specified by adding rows for each channel and specifying **net**, **subnet** and **universe**. Optionally, packets can be filtered using the **srcaddress** and **destaddress** columns; only packets that have a matching source IP address and destination IP address will be accepted. The cell values for these columns should be a single IP address (ie. regex not supported); if left blank then all packets will be accepted.

The **srcaddress** column is useful for when there is DMX noise on the network that needs to be filtered out; the IP of the desired controller can be specified in the **srcaddress** cell. The **id** column should be used in conjunction with **srcaddress** and **destaddress** to provide a unique channel suffix.

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a useful tool for debugging network issues. In the Art-Net case, packets can easily be filtered using **artnet**, **dmx**, or **dmx\_chan**.

**ENTTEC NOTE:** - Use ENTTEC's [NMU (Node Management Utility)](http://www.enttec.com/us/products/controls/dmx-over-ethernet/nmu/) to configure and inspect the ENTTEC devices found on your network.

DMX Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# DMX Out CHOP

The DMX Out CHOP sends channels to [DMX](DMX.html "DMX"), [Art-Net](Art-Net.html "Art-Net"), [sACN](SACN.html "SACN"), KiNET, or FTDI devices. Channel values for DMX are 0-255.

The first channel you send into the DMX Out will correspond to the first DMX address (DMX channel) As you add channels to the DMX Out, you will access the next DMX channels in order. For example, if you input 12 channels into the DMX out, you will be controlling DMX channels 1 thru 12.

The DMX in TouchDesigner was developed on the [ENTTEC](http://www.enttec.com/) device, namely their [DMX USB Pro](http://www.enttec.com/?main_menu=Products&pn=70304) and DMX over Ethernet devices, but it should work for many devices and software that support DMX/Art-Net/sACN/KiNET.

A Routing Table can be provided in a DAT where addresses can be specified by adding rows for each channel and specifying net, subnet and universe.

**macOS NOTE:** - ENTTEC USB Pro may not connect automatically, to enable it enter the following command in the Terminal:

`sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI`

**Tip**: See the [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") for setup and usage examples.

**Tip**: Use [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to watch your DMX network traffic.

## Parameters - DMX Page

* Enttec Generic Serial `serial` - Uses the operating system's serial calls to write data.

Format `format` - ⊞ - Select between sending Packet Per Sample or Packet Per Channel.

* Packet Per Sample `packetpersample` - Each channel acts as a DMX channel, ie. 512 channels for 1 universe.

* Packet Per Channel `packetperchan` - Each sample in a channel acts as a DMX channel. This allows for setting up a channel for each universe, ie. 1 channel with 512 samples for 1 universe. Add multiple channels for multiple universes.

Routing Table `routingtable` - Available when using Packet Per Channel Format for Art-Net or sACN. Use the docked Table DAT to route channels to the appropriate universes. Addresses can be specified by adding rows for each channel and specifying net, subnet, universe, and netaddress. The net, subnet, universe, and netaddress columns are optional and correspond to the DMX Out CHOP's Net, Subnet, Universe, and Network Address parameters respectively. If for example the `net` column is missing from the Routing Table, the `Net` parameter is used instead.

When removing the Routing Table from the parameter, the specified address will be used for the first channel while all other channels are assigned to consecutive addresses.

Send ArtSync `sendartsync` - When enabled will send out ArtSync packets. ArtSync packets are used to synchronize multiple universes together.
Device `device` - ⊞ - Select a DMX device from the menu.

Serial Port `serialport` - ⊞ - When the Interface parameter is set to Generic Serial this parameter lets you select which Serial (COM) port to use.

* COM1 `com1` -

* COM3 `com3` -

Rate `rate` - How often data is sent to the device (per second).
```
       WARNING: DMX512 devices have a maximum refresh rate of 44Hz. It is recommended that Rate <= 44 for reliable performance.

Net (0-127) `net` - When the Interface parameter is set to Art-Net, this sets the net address. A net is a groups of 16 consecutive subnets or 256 consecutive universes. The range for this parameter is 0-127. This is **not** a network IP address.
Subnet (0-15) `subnet` - When the Interface parameter is set to Art-Net, this sets the subnet address. A subnet is a group of 16 consecutive universes. The range for this parameter is 0-15. This is **not** a network subnet mask.
Universe `universe` - When the Interface parameter is set to Art-Net, this sets the universe address. A single DMX512 frame of 512 channels is referred to as a universe. The range for this parameter is 0-15.
CID `cid` - The unique ID of the sender.
Source `source` - User assigned name of source (for informative purposes).
Priority `priority` - The priority of the data being sent, if there are multiple sources.
Custom KiNET Port `customkinetport` - When enabled, can specify a custom port for the KiNET v2 interface. When disabled, the port will be the broadcast port: 255.
KiNET Port `kinetport` - Specifies the port for KiNET v2 interface.

## Parameters - Network Page

Multicast `multicast` - Enable multicast for sACN. Multicast automatically builds the IP based on Net, Subnet, and Universe of the device. This allows for sending to multiple devices at once by specifying multiple universes.
Network Address `netaddress` - Specify the IP address to use when Interface is set to Art-Net. This address corresponds to the receiving device address. When the address is set to its default 255.255.255.255, the messages are instead broadcast to all devices on the network. The Art-Net Net, Subnet and Universe of the receiving devices must still match those specified in the DMX Out CHOP in all cases.
Local Address `localaddress` - ⊞ - When the sending machine is equipped with multiple network adapters, this parameter can be used to choose which adapter to send the data from by specifying its IP address here.

* 192.168.0.102 `192.168.0.102` -

Local Port `localport` - In rare cases it can be necessary to supply a custom port from which the data should be sent. The default of `-1` means the O/S assigned port is being used.
Use Custom Port `customport` - Enable the Network Port parameter to specify the port of the receiving hardware.
Network Port `netport` - Let's you specify the port of the receiving hardware. By default and the spec of ArtNet this is set to 6454 and should only be changed in rare cases.

Engine COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Engine COMP

The Engine COMP will run a `.tox file` (component) in a separate process. It uses [TouchEngine](TouchEngine.html "TouchEngine") to manage these processes and pass data between the loaded component and the main project.

**Inputs and Outputs**

The chosen component's top-level Inputs and Outputs are exposed as inputs and outputs on the Engine COMP. Only [TOP](TOP.html "TOP"), [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") and [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") inputs and outputs are supported.

**Custom Parameters**

Any [custom parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters") on the top-level component are added to the Engine COMP's parameters. Custom parameters which refer to other nodes in the network, such as [TOP](TOP.html "TOP"), [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") and [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") parameters, are not supported - you should use inputs to connect those nodes instead.

Note that parameters work in one direction only - you cannot set a parameter from within the loaded `.tox`.

**External File Paths**

By default, relative paths on OPs or in scripts **inside** the loaded component are relative to the `.tox` file's location. This can be changed with the 'Asset Paths' parameter. Relative paths as file or folder custom parameters **of** the component - those that show up on the Engine COMP - are always relative to the main project.

**Monitoring Engine Status**

It is useful to monitor the state and performance of the Engine COMP. By default, an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") is docked to the Engine COMP and contains file path and process ID. A docked [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") contains three sets of monitoring channels: The Info Type menu is by default set to TouchEngine Status which gives loading / running / error status of the Engine process. Changing the menu to TouchEngine Perform gives the engine's performance statistics, and changing the menu to Initialize/Start give ready / running state information specifically about your loaded component since it can be paused, timed and re-initialized.

**Controlling Engine State**

The Engine process will be started by the TouchDesigner process and it will run your `.tox` component automatically. But you can have more control over the time/memory management of multiple components using the Unload, Reload pulse parameters for the currently-loaded `.tox` file. On the Advanced page, the Launch and Quit Engine Process parameters give you terminate/restart control of the entire Engine process.

**Component Lifetime**

Under TouchEngine, components are loaded into an already-running instance. For this reason, an [Execute DAT](Execute_DAT.html "Execute DAT")'s `onStart()` and `onExit()` method will never be executed under TouchEngine. The `onCreate()` method will be executed when the component is loaded, and is a good place to do any setup you would normally do in `onStart()`.

**Time in TouchEngine**

When the Engine COMP starts the component (after it has loaded, if 'Start when Initialized' is On), the component time in TouchEngine is `0`. It will then increase either in sync with the Engine COMP or according to TouchEngine's internal clock, depending on the setting of the 'Clock' parameter on the Tune parameter page.

An input buffer and output buffer are used to allow for differences in cook rate between the Engine COMP and TouchEngine. Often you may want to adjust the parameters on the Tune page to suit your particular setup. The Engine COMP will cook frames to fill its input buffer, if required, prior to starting to cook the component in TouchEngine - then will cook frames in TouchEngine to fill its output buffer prior to emitting output from the Engine COMP. The Auto setting will attempt to keep small buffers sufficient to avoid dropped frames, but you may wish to set a fixed buffer size to suit your setup, particularly if working with audio.

**TouchEngine Versions**

TouchEngine is installed as part of TouchDesigner, and the currently running version will be used to load the given `.tox`. If you wish to use a different version of TouchEngine you can either set the [environment variable](Variables.html#System_Environment_Variables "Variables") `TOUCHENGINE_APP_PATH` to the path to a TouchDesigner installation (an installation directory on Windows, or a TouchDesigner app on macOS) *or* install TouchDesigner into a folder named `TouchEngine` alongside the `.tox` (on macOS rename an application from TouchDesigner to TouchEngine) *or* create a link named `TouchEngine` alongside the `.tox` which points to an installation directory or TouchDesigner app.

Envelope CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Envelope CHOP

The Envelope CHOP outputs the maximum amplitude in the vicinity of each sample of the input. It takes the absolute value of the input, and uses a sliding window of a number of samples to find the maximum amplitude near each sample.

**Tip:** The loudness levels of an audio track can be kept roughly constant by computing an envelope of the audio with a wide window, and then passing the original audio and the envelope to a [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") and selecting **Combine CHOPs - Divide**. This will make the amplitude approximately 1.

* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common CHOP Info Channels](#Common_CHOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Envelope Page

Type `method` - ⊞ - The two methods of calculating the envelope:

* Exponential Decay `exp` - For each sample, the value is compared to the previous sample. If it is greater than the previous, the value of the envelope is equal to the value of that sample, and that sample is stored as the current peak. If it is less than, the value of the envelope decays exponentially from the last peak to the current value (as more samples pass that are smaller than the peak, the envelope decays toward the waveform). Pros: Always encloses the data. Cons: Slope can be discontinuous, making the output look bumpy.

* Local Maximum Window `window` - The channel is separated into windows of N samples determined by the Envelope Width. In each window, the maximum amplitude (or power) is found. The maximum value of the window is placed as a data point in the center of the window, and these points are cubically interpolated together to form the output envelope. Pros: Produces Good shapes. Cons: Signal sometimes jumps outside the envelope. The signal is quantized, so pulses can be off by as much as N/2.

Envelope Bounds `bounds` - ⊞ -

* Magnitude `mag` -

* Signal Power `power` -

* Maximum Values `min` -

* Minimum Values `max` -

Envelope Width `width` - The width of the window to use in the envelope calculation. Adjust this width to capture as many features of the input as needed. It is expressed in Units.
Envelope Width Unit `widthunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Interpolate `interp` - ⊞ -

* Cubic `cubic` -

Normalize Power Envelope `norm` - Keeps the total power in the signal constant when adjusting the Envelope Width.
Resample Envelope `resample` - When On, the envelope can be resampled to the Sample Rate specified in the parameter below.
Sample Rate `samplerate` - Set the sample rate to resample the envelope to when the Resample Envelope parameter above is On.

Extra Information for the Envelope CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Environment Light COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Environment Light COMP

The Environment Light Component controls the color and intensity of an environmental light in a given scene. This light, unlike the [Light Component](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP"), has no particular position. It comes from outside all of the objects in the scene and lights them. The orientation of the objects and the Environment Light Map will affect how each side of the objects is lit. However the position of the objects in space will have no effect on how the environment light hits them.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[environmentlightCOMP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/EnvironmentlightCOMP_Class "EnvironmentlightCOMP Class")

You can modify the color of the light three ways: Color List, Hue, Saturation, and Value, or Red, Green, and Blue. To choose one, click on the appropriate box and the color editing fields below change accordingly.

Dimmer `dimmer` - This parameter allows you to change the intensity of the light either as a static value or over time.
Environment Map `envlightmap` - Uses a TOP texture to define an environment map for the material. Environment mapping simulates an object reflecting its surroundings. The TOP defined in this parameter is the texture that will be reflected. The Env Map is added to whatever the normal lighting will be, so to make an object purely reflective turn the Diffuse and Specular parameters to 0. This input expects a sphere map. An example of a sphere map can be found [here](http://debevec.org/Probes/campus_probe.jpg). This input will also accept a cube map, created with the [Cube Map TOP](Cube_Map_TOP.html "Cube Map TOP") or the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP")'s Render Cube Map parameter.
Environment Map 2D Type `envlightmaptype2d` - ⊞ - Select the type of environment map to use (only equirectangular available for now).

* Equirectangular `equirect` - Use equirectangular format for the environment map.

Environment Map Quality `envlightmapquality` - Controls the number of samples used by the Environment Light which determines the quality of the result. This value is multiplied by the [PBR MATs](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT") Env Light Quality parameter.
Environment Map Rotate `envlightmaprotate` - ⊞ - Rotate the texture specified by the Environment Map parameter above.

* X `envlightmaprotatex` -

* Y `envlightmaprotatey` -

* Z `envlightmaprotatez` -

Use Pre-Filter Maps `envlightmapprefilter` - ⊞ - Controls how the environment map is pre-filtered. A pre-filtered environment map is expensive to create, but results in much better rendering quality.

* Off `off` - Disables pre-filtering the environment map. This is useful for animated environment maps, which can be far too expensive to pre-filter every frame. The rendering quality will be worse than when pre-filtering.

* Automatic `automatic` - Pre-filter the environment map as needed. This results in the best rendering quality, but is quite expensive if the map changes.

* From Pre-Filter TOP `useprefiltertop` - The output of the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") can be used instead, this allows for manually creating pre-filtered maps, including sequences of images for animated maps. The maps from the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") should be saved in a lossless format.

Pre-Filtered Specular Map `envlightspecmap` - The 'Environment Light Specular Map' output from the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") to use.

Extra Information for the Environment Light COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# EtherDream CHOP

**DEPRECATED:** use the [Laser Device CHOP](Laser_Device_CHOP.html "Laser Device CHOP") instead.

EtherDream is a laser controller. The EtherDream CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to an [EtherDream](http://ether-dream.com/) device via a network connection. The EtherDream device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the EtherDream CHOP. Applications of the EtherDream CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.

The EtherDream CHOP needs the IP address of the EtherDream device, which you can get from the output of an [EtherDream DAT](EtherDream_DAT.html "EtherDream DAT").

Blanking (all-off) occurs when the incoming RGB CHOP channels are all zero, or the Red Scale, Green Scale, and Blue Scale parameters are all zero.

It is sometimes helpful to have additional information with respect to the general state of the hardware, whether any warnings are generated by the connected devices, how well the EtherDream is receiving points, the point output rate, and the point buffer capacity. Such details can be seen by connecting the EtherDream CHOP to an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP"), and may be useful for troubleshooting display images.

The `maxrate` column of the EtherDream DAT indicates the maximum number of samples per second that can be sent to the EtherDream device, though in practice, most lasers are reflected into position by a set of mechanical reflectors, with their own mechanical characteristics. As a result, attempting to quickly scan a square over a large area too quickly, for example, may result in a very curved corners as the physical components lag behind their target positions.

Large changes in RGB values from sample-to-sample will likely be visibly correct as lasers generally can switch on-off quickly.

The range of X and Y is typically -1 to +1, and the range of RGB is typically 0 to 1.

If `maxrate` is 100,000, and given that the CHOP takes time-sliced data, it is appropriate to send a time-sliced CHOP with a sample rate of up to 100,000 samples per second to the EtherDream CHOP.

## Parameters - Ether Dream Page

Active `active` - If turned off, the EtherDream CHOP will stop sending data to the EtherDream and will immediately clear its point buffer. Consider it equivalent to powering off the EtherDream.
Network Address `netaddress` - Set this parameter to the network address that both the EtherDream and the user's computer are connected to. It should have the following format: `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`

To determine the required network address and to identify if the EtherDream is properly connected to the network, install and run the [EtherDream Diagnostic Tool](http://ether-dream.com/downloads.html).

Network Port `port` - By default, the EtherDream uses TCP Port `7765`. Firewall settings may need to be adjusted to allow for the EtherDream CHOP to properly communicate with the EtherDream.
Queue Time `queuetime` - Determines the queue size of the EtherDream point buffer and the corresponding time required to drain it. It is often useful to reduce this value when sending fewer points.
Queue Units `queueunits` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
X Scale `xscale` - Allows the input x values to be scaled by the specified factor.
Y Scale `yscale` - Allows the input y values to be scaled by the specified factor.
Red Scale `redscale` - Allows the input r values to be scaled by the specified factor.
Green Scale `greenscale` - Allows the input g values to be scaled by the specified factor.
Blue Scale `bluescale` - Allows the input b values to be scaled by the specified factor.

Evaluate DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Evaluate DAT

The Evaluate DAT changes the cells of the incoming DAT using string-editing and math expressions.

In its simplest form, without an input DAT attached, you can put any python expression in the Expression parameter of an Evaluate DAT. To evaluate the expression every frame you may need to put the parameter into Expression [Parameter Mode](Parameter_Mode.html "Parameter Mode").

With a DAT attached, it outputs a table with the same number of rows and columns as the input.

The Scope page can be used to restrict which rows and columns of cells are affected.

* When the Output menu is set to Expressions, it causes the input cells to be evaluated as Pythong expressions. `me.inputCell.val` is the value of the input cell.

* The optional second input DAT is an array of expressions which are matched to the cells of the input, then evaluated and output. If there are fewer rows in the second DAT than the first, the expressions in the last row of the second input are repeated. If there are fewer columns in the second DAT than the first, the last column is repeated.

* **Expressions are optimized by storing a compiled internal version, which runs much faster.** Use this where possible. If you are reusing expressions by repeating them in a table, having an input table with the few expressions you will cycle through separate from the data will also improve performance.

If the second DAT is one cell, like the Expression parameter, it applies its expression to all the input cells. A one-cell second DAT with `me.inputCell.val+1` adds 1 to all the first input's cells.

If the second DAT is

| `me.inputCell.val` | `me.inputCell.val` |
| --- | --- |
| `me.inputCell.val` | `math.sin(math.radians(float(me.inputCell.val)))` |

then the first row and first column are left intact and the rest of the cells get their `sin()` computed.

[![EvaluateDAT ex.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/f/f6/EvaluateDAT_ex.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:EvaluateDAT_ex.png)

The Evaluate DAT maintains the format of the first input DAT (table or text) unless the Output Table Size parameter is used.

## Expressions

The Evaluate DAT can be used to (1) build strings or (2) do math operations.

`me.inputCell` refers to the corresponding input cell that is used to evaluate the current cell. [evaluateDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/EvaluateDAT_Class "EvaluateDAT Class") has a list of members that refer to incoming data. You can use [Python](Python.html "Python") to fetch data, like `op('datpath')[row,col]` to access DAT data and `op('choppath')['channame'][sampleindex]` to access CHOP data. A few examples:

# access data from a particular row from the input table at the currently evaluated column
me.inputTable['rowname',me.inputCol]

# prefix the data in the current cell the input row and column

# a string in the first cell will be formatted as [0,0]:string
'['+str(me.inputRow)+','+str(me.inputCol)+']:'+me.inputCell

# add the numeric data in the current cell to numeric data from another table
op('datpath")[me.inputRow,'colname'] + me.inputCell

# concatenate the numeric data in the current cell to string data from another table with a space between
op('datpath')[me.inputRow,'colname'] + ' ' + me.inputCell

# concatenate the current row number to string data from another table with a space between
op('datpath')[me.inputRow,'colname'] + ' ' + str(me.inputRow)

# concatenate a sample at the currrent row index from a chop channel with the current cell
me.inputCell + ':' + str(op('choppath')['channame'][me.inputRow])

See [Working with DATs in Python](https://docs.derivative.ca/Working_with_DATs_in_Python "Working with DATs in Python") and [Working with CHOPs in Python](https://docs.derivative.ca/Working_with_CHOPs_in_Python "Working with CHOPs in Python") for more examples of accessing data in other operators.

You can also use any [Tscript Expressions](Tscript_Expressions.html "Tscript Expressions") to fetch data, like ``tab("tabpath",row,col)`` and ``chop("choppath")``. A list of local variables, such as `$V` for the value of the corresponding input cell, is available, and you can use other Tscript [Variables](Variables.html "Variables") like `$F` and `$SYS_XRES`.

A few Tscript expressions `v()` and `vs()` are special to the Evaluate DAT and can access all cells in the input. `vs()` differs from `v()` as it always output strings, not floats.

The expressions `v(row,col)` and `vs(row,col)` can use the local variables `R` (the cell's row) and `C` (the cell's column).

* `v($R,$C)` is the same as `$V`.
* `v($C,$R)` transposes the cells.
* You could address relative rows/columns with `$C`, `$C-1`, `$C+1`, and address the cell at the first column with `v($R,0)`. `v` will return the cell contents as floats. `vs` will return cell contents as strings.

The expressions that let you get at cells by row/column names are:

* `vr(rowname,colnum)`
* `vc(rownum,colname)`
* `vrc(rowname,colname)`

and the string versions of the above:

* `vsr(rowname,colnum)`
* `vsc(rownum,colname)`
* `vsrc(rowname,colname)`

Example: `vrc("john","august")`

The local variables `NR` and `NC` give the number of rows and columns of the input table.

## Parameters - Evaluate Page

Input Data DAT `dat` - An alternative DAT table to be used in place of an input table.
Expressions DAT `datexpr` - An alternative DAT table to be used in place of a formula table.
Output `output` - ⊞ - Determines what format will be used for output from the DAT.

* Evaluate `evaluate` - Evaluates input data as python expressions. **Compiled**.

* Input Data `data` - Passes through data from first input without manipulation.

* Input Expression `expression` - Passes through first input if there is no second input. Otherwise passes through second input. If the first input has more rows or columns than the second one, then the last row or column of the second is repeated to fill out the extra cells.

Expression `expr` - Expression used to evaluate each cell if an Expression input or DAT is not supplied.
Output Table Size `outputsize` - ⊞ - If the Output Table Size parameter is Strings, Expressions, or Commands, and there is a second input, you can choose the output table size to be either Input DAT or the Formula DAT. If the Formula DAT is chosen and its table size is greater than the input data table, then the last cell in each row or column will be used when evaluating the remaining formulas.

* Input 1 (Data) `in1` -

* Input 2 (Expressions) `in2` -

Monitor Data Dependencies `dependency` - If the Output parameter is set to Strings or Expressions, the DAT will monitor any nodes used by the data, as well as check for time dependencies, and cook accordingly. This toggle is on by default. If you only want the DAT to cook based on input changes, you can turn this off to avoid unnecessary updates.
Convert Backslash Characters `backslash` - Will convert things like \n to newlines, \t to tabs etc. Note that \n, \t will be converted to spaces if the input DAT is a table.

## Parameters - Scope Page

Exclude First Row `xfirstrow` - Forces the first row to be selected even if it is not specified by the Select Rows settings.
Exclude First Col `xfirstcol` - Forces the first column to be selected even if it is not specified by the Select Cols settings.
Select Rows `extractrows` - ⊞ - This parameter allows you to pick different ways of specifying the rows selected.

In Tscript, you can access the cell value with the local variable `$V`, and the row and column with `$R` and `$C`

Start Col Name `colnamestart` - Specify the column name to start the selection range from.
Start Col Index `colindexstart` - Specify the column index to start the selection range from.
End Col Name `colnameend` - Specify the column name to end the selection range.
End Col Index `colindexend` - Specify the column index to end the selection range.
Col Select Values `colnames` - Specify actual column names that you want to select. You can use pattern matching, for example `colvalue[1-4]` will select all the columns named colvalue1 thru colvalue4.
Col Select Condition `colexpr` - Specify an expression that will be evaluated. If the expression evaluates to true, the column will be selected. See Row Select Condition for more details.
From Row `fromrow` - When extracting columns by Specified Names, this parameter selects which row to use when matching cell values to Selected Col Values to determine which columns are selected.

# Event CHOP

The Event CHOP manages the birth and life of overlapping events triggered by devices like a MIDI keyboard. It can be seen as a simple particle system designed for MIDI keyboards.

The Event CHOP generates one sample for each off-to-on event in the input channels, which would often come from a [MIDI In CHOP](MIDI_In_CHOP.html "MIDI In CHOP"), [MIDI In Map CHOP](MIDI_In_Map_CHOP.html "MIDI In Map CHOP"), [Keyboard In CHOP](Keyboard_In_CHOP.html "Keyboard In CHOP"), or python events sent to the Event CHOP. The sample exists for the duration of the event's attack+decay+sustain+release time.

**NOTE**: See the examples in Help->[OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets")

The Event CHOP can used to follow a polyphonic music keyboard with MIDI velocity, and can generate generating one object, polygon or geometry instance for each event. It assures the object, polygon or instance exists until the event ends after an attack-decay-sustain-release phase. The Event CHOP is often fed through other OPs to the Instance parameters of a Geometry component.

The Event CHOP outputs up to 8 channels, with one sample generated per off-to-on event that is active. The sample is active until the attack-decay-sustain-release is over, at which moment the sample disappears (like particle death).

Watch the channel graph of the Event CHOP to understand what it is doing. It can be sent to a [Limit SOP](Limit_SOP.html "Limit SOP") or a [Channel SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP") to place geometry for each event. You can send event information to the SOP via the Event CHOP channels that get transformed into geometry channels like `tx`, `ty`, `scale`, texture v (giving movie time offsets), alpha, r, g and b colors.

On a MIDI keyboard, you can trigger many events simultaneously, and, like particles, you may want to launch objects that remain in existence the next time you press the same key.

The Event CHOP is designed to handle this. It creates one sample every time you press any key, and that sample lives for any length of time. This CHOP is lightweight - the minimum number of channels and samples are created, even with 88-key MIDI keyboards and lots of pounding on the keyboard.

There are channels that represent age, note number and MIDI velocity when you pressed the key, as well as a flag telling if the key has since been released.

Each event has a unique ID, held in the `id` channel that can be used to generate random XY displacements of each note, for example.

A movie index is set by the `state` channel which rises from 0 to 1 and loops between 1 to 2 continuously until the note goes into its release state at which time it goes from 2 to 3. So for a bird cycle, you use the 0 to 1 state for the jump phase, 1 to 2 for the flappin in flight phase, and 2 to 3 for the landing phase.

The Event CHOP's 1st input is for event triggers.

The 2nd input resets the triggers.

The 3rd input is optional and allows for sampling values for each event.

  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

The Event CHOP outputs seven channels that define the properties of the events.

ID `id` - The sequence # of the event, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each event.
Index `index` - The channel index of the incoming CHOP that caused the event.
Active `active` - While the input is greater than 0 this channel goes to 1, ie when the input channel goes "On".
Input `input` - The value of the input channel when the input went on (at the birth of the event). It is often the note velocity value. If you pass the Midi In CHOP into the Event CHOP, and set the Midi In option to output the velocity, velocity will end up in this channel and preserved until the event ends.
Time `time` - Time in seconds from the start of the event.
ADSR `adsr` - The value according to the Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. It uses the parameters on the ADSR page, regulating the speed and values, with extended parameters: Attack Time, Attack Level, Decay Time, Sustain Time, Sustain Min, Sustain Max, Release Time, Release Level.
State `state` - This is good for playing back movies. You divide your movie into 4 parts that correspond to the (0=attack, 1=decay, 2=sustain, 3=release) phases. The state channel outputs fractional values, so you can watch it climb through all the transitions, including multiple sustain-sections. e.g., 0...1...2...2...2...2...3...4. If your movie is 8 seconds long, take the state channel and multiply by 2, passing it as the time-index of the movie.

Goes from 0 to 1 during the attack phase, 1 to 2 as it repeats in the sustain phase, and 2 to 3 in the release phase. It is suitable for indexing movies.

Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - Determines the reset behavior of using the 2nd Input Reset Trigger. This parameter is only active if there is an input connected to the CHOP's 2nd input.

* Off to On `offtoon` -

* While On `on` -

* On to Off `ontooff` -

* While Off `off` -

Reset `reset` - When set to 'On' it resets the CHOP clearing all events.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Immediately resets the CHOP and clears all events in the frame it was clicked.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The path to a DAT containing onCreate() and onDestroy() callbacks for each event.

Execute DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Execute DAT

The Execute DAT lets you edit scripts and run them based on conditions. It can be executed at the start or end of every frame, or at the start or end of the TouchDesigner process.

Execute DATs are created with [default python method placeholders](https://docs.derivative.ca/ExecuteDAT_Class "ExecuteDAT Class"). For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

Text can also can be passed into the Text DAT through the node's input, however this text will not be editable. Text can be created in the DAT via the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer") or an external text editor.

See also [OP Execute DAT](OP_Execute_DAT.html "OP Execute DAT").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[executeDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ExecuteDAT_Class "ExecuteDAT Class")

Active `active` - While on, the DAT will respond to the events selected below.
Execute from `executeloc` - ⊞ - ([Tscript](Operator_Language.html "Operator Language") only) Determines the location the script is run from.

From Operator `fromop` - This component is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to *Specified Operator*.
Start `start` - The onStart() method is executed when TouchDesigner starts. This method is never called in TouchEngine because components are loaded after TouchEngine has started.
Create `create` - The create() method is executed when the node is created. This can be triggered on start, by loading a component from disk, by copying & pasting, or any other way a node can be created.
Exit `exit` - The onExit() method is executed when the TouchDesigner process quits.
Frame Start `framestart` - The onFrameStart() method is executed at the start of every frame.
Frame End `frameend` - The onFrameEnd() method is executed at the end of every frame.
Play State Change `playstatechange` - The onPlayStateChange() method is executed each time the play state changes, ie. pause or play is used on the timeline.
Device Change `devicechange` - The onDeviceChange() method is executed each time devices are connected or disconnected from the computer. For example, plugging in MIDI devices, cameras, joysticks, etc.

**NOTE:** When using multiple Execute DATs with Start and Create functions, they are triggered in numbered-alphanumeric order of the DAT's names.

**TIP:** To direct all "standard output" of python to a Text DAT, put this in the `start()` method: `sys.stdout = op('text1')`

To safely to this and restore standard output:

```
prev = sys.stdout
sys.stdout = op('text1')
sys.stdout = prev

Expression CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Expression CHOP

The Expression CHOP allows you to modify input channels by using math expressions. Each input channel is modified by exactly one expression, and the expressions are looped for multiple channels.

The output is the same length and set of channels as the first input, but its sample values are changed according to the expressions.

An expression is applied to each keyframe value or raw sample. If there are more channels coming from input 0 than expressions, the expressions are recycled. A Channels per Expression parameter controls how many channels to apply the first expression to before going on to the second expression.

The corresponding input values are `me.inputVal` in the expressions. `me.inputs[1][0]` gets from the first channel of the second input.

See also [Evaluate DAT](Evaluate_DAT.html "Evaluate DAT") for easy evaluation of any expression.

Extend CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Extend CHOP

The Extend CHOP only sets the "extend conditions" of a CHOP, which determines what values you get when sampling the CHOP before or after its interval.

The Extend CHOP has separate menus to control both the pre-interval and the post-interval. For example, before the interval, you may want to hold a constant value, and after the interval you may want to cycle or repeat the curves in the interval.

To shorten or lengthen the interval (the start or end of the CHOP), use the [Trim CHOP](Trim_CHOP.html "Trim CHOP").

You can see the state of Extend Conditions in the pop-up info of any CHOP (use middle-mouse click on the CHOP).

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[extendCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ExtendCHOP_Class "ExtendCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Extend Page

Left Behavior `left` - ⊞ - The extend condition before the CHOP interval. They are:

* No Change `asis` - Leave the channel as is.

Right Behavior `right` - ⊞ - Extend condition after the interval. Same options as Extend Left.

# Extrude SOP

The Extrude SOP can be used for:

* Extruding and bevelling Text and other geometry
* Cusping the bevelled edges to get sharp edges
* Making primitives thicker or thinner

The default is a 1 unit extrusion directly backwards from the input geometry's normals.

It uses the normal of the surface to determine the direction of extrusion. In the case of planar or open polygons, the normal is difficult to determine, and may not always provide the result that you expect. Turn on the Primitive Normals display in the [Viewer](Viewer.html "Viewer") display options to see the normals.

The extrusion is created by extending surfaces from the vertices of the input geometry along the cross-section curve given in the second input (Input 1). The first vertex of the cross-section curve is placed by default at the vertices of the input geometry and aligned so that the curve's positive Y axis extends opposite to the input geometry's normal. The cross-section's positive X axis by default extends outwards from center of the input geometry.

If no cross-section curve is given, a vertical line going from (0,0,0) to (0,1,0) is used. This results in a 1 unit extrusion directly backwards from the input geometry's normals. As another example, using a straight line from (0,0,0) to (.1,.1,0) will result in an extrusion that extends 1 unit backwards from the input and flares .1 unit outwards on all sides. The Thickness and Depth parameters can be used to shift and scale the cross-section without directly changing the curve.

**Note:** The shape of the cross-section is always relative to its first vertex, so shifting the entire cross-section curve will have no effect. Also, only the X and Y axes of the curve are used i.e. Z position values are ignored.

After the new geometry is created, normals are computed by default.

**Warning:** If you take a default output from a [Text SOP](Text_SOP.html "Text SOP") and Extrude it, it may have bad rendering artifacts (and too many polygons) as it's extruding each of the triangles of the triangulated letters. You need to change the Output parameter of the Text SOP to Closed Polygons. See [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets").

Source Group `sourcegrp` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified for the source. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
X-Section Group `xsectiongrp` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified for the cross-section. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

## Parameters - Values Page

Fuse Points `dofuse` - ⊞ - This should almost always be turned on when cross-sections are used. It consolidates points of polygons that would otherwise cross or overlap when the bevel takes place.

* No fusion `off` -

* Clamp all points `all` -

* Clamp minimal set `min` -

* Clamp individual face `on` -

* Clamp straight `straight` -

Front Face `fronttype` - ⊞ - Control how the front face of the extrusion should be built. You may wish to have a "No Output" because some faces are never actually seen when doing animation and, therefore, would only take up additional overhead if left on.

* No Output `off` - No face is created.

* Output Face `face` - Faces are created.

* Convex Face `convex` - Create faces built with Convex Polygons (use this option if faces are to be deformed, i.e. [Twist SOP](Twist_SOP.html "Twist SOP"), [Lattice SOP](Lattice_SOP.html "Lattice SOP")).

Back Face `backtype` - ⊞ - This value controls whether or not the back of the extruded object will have a face or not. The options are the same as the Front Face options above.

* No Output `off` -

* Output Face `face` -

* Convex Face `convex` -

Side Mesh `sidetype` - ⊞ - Controls how the cross-section(s) will be extruded. If the input cross-section is a Bzier or NURBS curve, the surface will be constructed with a patch of the same geometry type.

* No Output `off` - No mesh is created.

Initialize Extrusion `initextrude` - If the cross-section face that you created doesn't match up nicely to the size of the geometry you are extruding, this command will scale and translate it so that it fits nicely.

The reason it might not be nice to begin with is that the curve wasn't drawn exactly on the world-axis in Model-mode and/or was drawn at a grossly different scale than the object it is extruding.

Thickness Translate `thickxlate` - Shifts the cross-section profile perpendicularly to the normals of the input geometry. This relates to the X axis of the cross-section profile. When used with text, this typically has the effect of making the text lighter (narrower) or heavier (bolder).
Thickness Scale `thickscale` - Scales the cross-section profile perpendicularly to the normals of the input geometry. This is equivalent to scaling the cross-section in its X axis. This parameter has no effect on the default profile, which is equivalent to a vertical line along the Y axis. Negative scaling values are allowed.
Depth Translate `depthxlate` - Moves the cross-section in the direction of the normal. Positive values will move backwards to the direction of the normal. Depth movement relates to the Y axis of the input cross-section. Using this parameter will shift the position of the output geometry in direction of the normal.
Depth Scale `depthscale` - Scales the cross-section in the direction of the source geometry's normals. This is equivalent to scaling the input cross-section in its Y axis and will determine how deep (thick) the resulting extrusion is.
Vertex `vertex` - Translates the cross-section such that the vertex specified is at the cross-section origin.
Cusp Polygonal Sides `docusp` - Determines whether or not sides are to be smooth-shaded or faceted using the angle value in Side Cusp Angle field.

Cusping lets you specify at which angle between adjacent polygons, a sharp edge (faceted edge where vertices are un-shared) should be displayed instead.

Side Cusp Angle `cuspangle` - When checked, this value will control the angle at which faceting of the sides will occur. A value of 20 is default.
Consolidate Faces to Mesh `sharefaces` - If selected the extrusion will share points between the front face and the first row of the side mesh and between the last face and the last row of the side mesh.
Remove Shared Sides `removesharedsides` - Prevents the creation of duplicate sides.

## Parameters - Groups Page

Create Output Groups `newg` - When this option is checked, it causes the Extrude SOP to generate three new groups representing the primitives belonging to the front faces, back faces, and the side bevel/extrusion. The name of the groups are determined by the three option fields below.
Front Group `frontgrp` - Output group name to create for front face geometry.
Back Group `backgrp` - Output group name to create for back face geometry.
Side Group `sidegrp` - Output group name to create for side bevel/extrude geometry.

## Production Tips

This SOP is mainly used for generating bevels and extrusions of text where the input cross-sections are fed from a [Font SOP](Font_SOP.html "Font SOP"). Any curve or group of curves can also be used as input.

Offsets - This SOP can be used for generating two offsetting curves where the distance between the two curves remains constant. To do this, make sure that you set Side Mesh to No Output, the first thickness to zero and adjust the second to increase or decrease the distance of the offset.

Fixing Stray Normals - If your geometry contains normals that are pointed in many directions (say after reading geometry from a [File In SOP](File_In_SOP.html "File In SOP"), or if you have a lot of open or non-planar polygons), you can fix it so that they are suitable for extrusion.

Do this by appending a [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP") to the SOP that contains your geometry, enable Normal, and reduce the Spread Angle to something less than 180. Then append a [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP"), which should work on the group made in the Group SOP. In the Face/Hull page, set the Vertex menu to Reverse.

Now the normals in your geometry will all be oriented in the roughly the same direction, and ready for extrusion. To narrow the tolerance, decrease the Spread Angle further.

Extra Information for the Extrude SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Face Track CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Face Track CHOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This operator uses the Augmented Reality (AR) SDK of the Nvidia Maxine system and requires a 20 series and above Nvidia RTX card to operate.

The Face Track CHOP can detect faces and facial landmark points in an image, as well as the direction the face is looking relative to the camera. Using a compatible 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) and the [Face Track SOP](Face_Track_SOP.html "Face Track SOP"), it can also be used to fit and animate a 3D mesh to the detected face.

The input image is taken from a provided TOP and can be of any resolution or format, and either a still image or video. If multiple faces are present in an image, the CHOP will attempt to track the largest one detected.

**Tip**: Look at the several examples of the Face Track CHOP/SOP in [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets").

To align a 3D rendering of the points with the original input image, set the 'Projection' of your [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") to 'Orthographic', the 'Ortho Origin' parameter to 'Bottom-Left', and the 'Ortho Width' to 1, while also enabling 'Aspect Correct' on the Face Track CHOP.

To use the mesh fitting features you will need a compatible face mesh file in the Nvidia '`nvf`' format. We recommend using the `face_model2.nvf` file that is now included in the `Config/Models` folder inside your TouchDesigner installation. **Note:** Mesh files generated for previous versions of TouchDesigner will no longer work.

  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - FaceTrack Page

Active `active` - Enables the face tracking features.
Model Folder `modelfolder` - The location of the AI model files used for face detection. By default these files are located in the Config/Models folder.
Mesh File `meshfile` - The 3D morphable mesh file in Nvidia 'nvf' format to use in mesh fitting. When available, the fitted mesh can be accessed with a [Face Track SOP](Face_Track_SOP.html "Face Track SOP").
TOP `top` - A path to the TOP operator that will provides the image to perform face tracking on.
Bounding Boxes `bbox` - Output channels that describe a bounding box around the detected face. The channels give the u and v positions of the center of the face as well as the width and height of the box. The positions are relative to the bottom-left corner of the input image.
Bounding Box Confidence `bboxconfidence` - Outputs a channel that describes the level of certainty that the AI model has detected a face in the input image. Higher numbers indicate greater confidence.
Rotations `rotations` - Output rx, ry, and rz values that indicate how the face is oriented in the image. (0,0,0) indicates that the face is oriented directly towards the camera. Values can range from +/- 180 degrees as the subject turns away from the camera.
Number of Landmarks `landmarks` - ⊞ -

* None `none` - The number of facial landmark points to output. Points are numbered beginning from 1 and always represent a fixed feature on the face such as the chin, eyebrow, nose, etc. Positions are given as u and v coordinates relative to the bottom-left corner of the input image.

* 68 (Multi-PIE Mark-ups) `num68` - A standard set of facial landmark features used in AI research. [See Reference Diagram.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-68-Multi-PIE-landmarks-scheme-and-the-landmarks-selected-for-our-method-marked-by-the_fig1_311741971)

* 126 `num126` - An extended set of landmark features.

Landmark Confidence `landmarkconfidence` - Adds a confidence value for each landmark feature. Higher values indicate the feature is more likely to be accurate.
Mesh Transform `meshtransform` - Enable to output translate, rotate and scale channels for the fitted face mesh. This feature requires a valid 3D morphable face mesh file (see notes above). The values from these channels can be used to transform the mesh produced by an attached [Face Track SOP](Face_Track_SOP.html "Face Track SOP") so that it aligns with the input image. By default the fitted mesh is pre-transformed to align with the image, but if 'Pre-Transform' is disabled in the SOP, these values can be used instead for more control and speed.
Aspect Correct UVs `aspectcorrectuv` - Rescales the the u and v positions so that they have the correct aspect ratio of the input image. This is useful when using the u, v positions as 3D coordinates rather than as image positions.

Extra Information for the Face Track CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Face Track SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Face Track SOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This operator uses the Augmented Reality (AR) SDK of the Nvidia Maxine system and requires a 20 or 30 series Nvidia RTX card to operate. 40 series cards are supported in 2023 and newer releases.

The Face Track SOP provides accesses to the fitted face mesh generated by the Face Track CHOP. It can either be uploaded directly to the GPU for rendering or passed along to other SOPs for further modification. By default, the mesh is pre-transformed to align with the source face of the input image (x, y positions equal image u,v positions). However, you can also disable the pre-transform which will leave the fitted mesh at the origin in the original scale. The mesh can still be aligned with the image using the tx, ty, rx, etc channels of the [Face Track CHOP](Face_Track_CHOP.html "Face Track CHOP").

**Note:**  To use this feature you will need to provide a compatible 3D morphable face mesh file in Nvidia 'nvf' format to the 'Mesh File' parameter of the [Face Track CHOP](Face_Track_CHOP.html "Face Track CHOP"). This file does not ship with TouchDesigner, but instructions on creating one are provided on the [Face Track CHOP](Face_Track_CHOP.html "Face Track CHOP") page.

Face Track CHOP `chop` - The path to the Face Track CHOP that generates the mesh.
Direct to GPU `directtogpu` - When active, the mesh will be transferred directly to the GPU. This method is much faster, but does not allow it to be transformed further by additional SOPs.
Pre-Transform Mesh `pretransform` - The fitted mesh will be transformed to align with the input image that was used to create the mesh. When disabled, the mesh will be positioned at the origin at its original scale.
Compute Normals `normals` - Enable to automatically generate smooth vertex normals for the face mesh.

# Facet SOP

The Facet SOP lets you control the smoothness of faceting of a given object. It also lets you consolidate points or surface normals.

The Facet SOP, like [Divide SOP](Divide_SOP.html "Divide SOP"), works as a pipeline to change geometry in stages. For this reason, Compute Normals appears twice. For example, you can compute surface normals before making vertices (the points of each polygon) unique, which gives you the unusual result of smooth shading and unique point, as the normals get computed while the points are still shared.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[facetSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FacetSOP_Class "FacetSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Make Normals Unit Length `unit` - Checking this option will normalize the length of normals to a length of one unit.
Compute Normals `prenml` - Checking this option means that the surface normals will be computed. Where points are shared between polygons, smooth shading results, and where points are not shared (unique), faceted edges result. If you compute normals at this stage, they are computed based on the incoming geometry.
Unique Points `unique` - Makes each vertex have a unique point. The result of selecting this option is that all vertices are made into unique points, thus making all edges hard, with no smooth shading.
Consolidate `cons` - ⊞ - Consolidate eliminates the redundancy of having many points that are close to each other, by merging them together to form a fewer set of common points. Consolidate is useful for cleaning up an edge that may appear between adjacent polygons that have been merged.

* No Consolidate `none` - No consolidation.

* Consolidate Points Slow `points` -

* Consolidate Points Fast `fpoints` -

* Consolidate Normals Slow `normals` -

* Consolidate Normals Fast `fnormals` -

Distance `dist` - Points and normals less than this distance apart will be consolidated, or have their normals averaged, based on the setting in the Consolidate menu.

Usually very small numbers, such as `0.01` should be used here. If the value is `0.0`, then points must be in exactly the same position (co-incident) in order to be considered for the consolidation/averaging function.

Remove Inline Points `inline` - Removes points that lie inline with its neighboring points.
Distance `inlinedist` - Set the distance threshold for removing inline points when the above parameter is On.
Orient Polygons `orientpolys` - Orients all polygons so they have the same winding direction.
Cusp Polygons `cusp` - Most of the time, you want some polygons to be smooth shaded and others to be faceted. Usually polygons that meet at low angles should be smooth shaded, and polygon edges that meet at sharper angles should be faceted.
Cusp Angle `angle` - Cusping allows you to specify the threshold angle at which the edges become faceted. A good typical value is 20.
Remove Degenerate `remove` - Sometimes (not often) your geometry can get messed up, where there are points hanging around that are not used for anything, or there are primitives that don't make sense. This option checks for these cases and removes them.
Compute Normals `postnml` - Again, allows you to compute the normals after the consolidation or cusping stages. You should select this if you have set either the Cusp or Consolidate option.

Extra Information for the Facet SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Fan CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Fan CHOP

The Fan CHOP converts one channel out to many channels, or converts many channels down to one.

Its first operation, **Fan Out**, takes one channel and generates 2 or more channels. It sets to 1 one of the output channels while all others are 0, based on the input channel's value. The first output channel is index value 0, the second, 1, and so on. If the input value is above N-1 or below 0, the value can be clamped, cycled or ignored.

For example, if the value of the input channel at a certain frame is 4, and if the CHOP outputs 8 channels, the fifth channel will have a value of 1, and all other channels will have a zero value at that frame.

The input is assumed to have 1 channel which contains integer values; fractions are truncated and extra channels are ignored. The output channels are binary (0 or 1) channels.

The second operation, **Fan In**, does the opposite: it takes a bunch of binary inputs and produces one channel containing the index of the "On" channel. If more than one input channel is "On", the first "On" input channel is selected.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[fanCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FanCHOP_Class "FanCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Fan Page

Operation `fanop` - ⊞ - Selects either Fan In or Fan Out.

* Fan Out `out` -

* Fan In `in` -

Channel Names `channame` - The names for the output channels that this CHOP creates. This also controls how many output channels are created (one for each name) in Fan Out mode. In Fan In mode, only one channel is created, and its name is the base name (minus the number suffix) of the first input channel.
Outside Range `range` - ⊞ - Determines how to handle input values that are outside the index range (0 to N-1).

* Clamp Index `clamp` - If less than 0, clamp to 0, and if greater than N-1, clamp to N-1.

* Loop Index `loop` - Loop back through the index list.

* Set Channels To 0 `zero` - Don't select any channels; set every channel to zero.

All Channels Off `alloff` - ⊞ - For a Fan In operation, when all input channels are off, set the output to -1 or 0.

* Set To 0 `set0` - Selects the first channel.

* Set To -1 `setneg` - Doesn't select any of the channels.

Quantize Output `quantize` - On by default. Channels are quatized to the nearest integer. For example, if the input channel's value is 5.6 and 6 channels are created, channel 5 is 1, while the rest are 0.

FBX COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# FBX COMP

The FBX COMP imports geometry, animations and scenes using the FBX file format from Maya, 3DS Max, Cinema4D, Houdini and others.
The FBX COMP currently uses the 2020.3.7 (VS2022) version of the FBX SDK.

[FBX](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fbx/overview) is a file format and set of libraries from Autodesk that is used to exchange models, animations and image/texture data between applications. The FBX COMP reads FBX files and supports most of its features. You can drag-drop a `.fbx` into a TouchDesigner network or import it via the File > Import File... menu. The FBX COMP can also import meshes from .obj and .4ds files, see also [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types").

The assets from the FBX file are saved into a "`.tdc`" file with the same name as the FBX file inside the `TDImportCache` folder, which is created next to your `.toe` file. Assets are read from the "`.tdc`" file using Import Select OPs ([Import Select TOP](Import_Select_TOP.html "Import Select TOP") / [Import Select SOP](Import_Select_SOP.html "Import Select SOP") / [Import Select CHOP](Import_Select_CHOP.html "Import Select CHOP")). Upon reloading a `.toe` file, the assets can be imported directly from the "`.tdc`" cache, and the FBX file will not need to be re-imported. However, if there is no existing "`.tdc`" (for instance, if the toe file changed computers) then the FBX file will be reopened to grab the assets and a new "`.tdc`" will be saved out.

To open an FBX file in an FBX COMP:

1) Specify a valid file path in the "FBX File" parameter, including the name of the file with correct `.fbx` extension.

2) This step is varied depending on whether the FBX COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the "Import" button to generate the FBX network and import the assets. Note that we recommend changing the "Import Method" to to other modes (less work) can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the "Import" button requires the network to be built again.

3) With the "Import Method" menu set to "Merge with Existing", the "Import" pulse will reload the internal assets (e.g. meshes, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the `.toe` file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.

4) With the "Import Method" menu set to "Import Assets (Import Selects)", the "Import" button is used when some changes on FBX file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.

**Animation channels**: When there is animation in the FBX file, use the controls on the Play page to initialize, start and guide the animation. Also create an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") and attach it to the FBX COMP to watch its animation timing. The Info CHOP channels are similar to those of the [Timer CHOP](Timer_CHOP.html "Timer CHOP").

**Textures**: Textures can either be embedded within the FBX file or external and referenced by a path to a texture file. For example, Blender has an option during FBX export to embed, otherwise they'll be external. If they're external then they may be exported with an absolute path to the texture file, which means if you move the FBX file to a different machine or relocate the file, then the textures will fail to load. In this case, if you are unable to re-export to embed the textures, then you can instead specify a search directory using the Texture Directory parameter so that the FBX COMP knows where to locate the texture files at import.

## Parameters - FBX Page

**NOTE:** changes to any of the below parameters aren’t applied until the FBX File is rebuilt, either through "Build Network" or "Update".

FBX File `file` - The FBX file to import.
Import Method `importmethod` - ⊞ - Determines what to do when clicking the 'Import' button below.

* Full Replacement `full` - Fully rebuilds the network inside the FBX COMP and reloads the assets from the FBX file.

* Merge with Existing `merge` - Merges any changes in the FBX file with the existing contents of the FBX COMP.

* Reload Assets (Import Selects) `reload` - Assets that are loaded into Import Select operators (geos, textures, animations) are reloaded into the existing FBX COMP's network from the FBX file.

Import `imp` - A pulse to import the contents based on the setting in the 'Import Method' parameter above.
Import Scale `importscale` - Scales the imported geometry as a multipier.
Texture Directory `texdir` - Specifies an additional search location for external texture files if they can't be found at the default location specified inside the FBX file.
Lights `lights` - When enabled the FBX COMP will import any lights within the FBX File.
Cameras `cameras` - When enabled the FBX COMP will import any cameras within the FBX File.
Generate Actor COMPs `genactors` - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs. This is useful for working with [Bullet Dynamics](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") systems with your imported geometry.
Merge Geometry `mergegeo` - When enabled the FBX COMP will merge Geometry COMPs. Geometry COMPs are merged if they have only default parameters except transform. If they have the same material then their Import Select SOPs will be merged.
Merge Level `mergelevel` - When enabled the FBX COMP will attempt to merge up to the desired “level”. Level is how many steps down a node is from the root (FBX COMP). If its level is higher than the merge level and it is mergeable then it will be merged upward.
Primitive Groups `primgroups` - When enabled the FBX COMP will put each merged SOP into its own primitive group, so that they can be split up later if need be.
Max Wired Children `maxwiredchildren` - Any COMPs that have more wired children than this parameter will have those wired children converted to internal children of the COMP. This maintains parenting but can cleanup networks.
Direct to GPU `gpudirect` - Load the geometry directly to the GPU.
Keep Parameters `keepparams` - When enabled, any parameter conflicts during update will keep the user changes. When disabled, any user changes to parameters may be overwritten.
Keep Connections `keepconnections` - When enabled, any wiring/connection conflicts during update will keep the user changes. When disabled, any user changes to wiring/connections may be overwritten.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The Callbacks DAT will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.

## Parameters - Play Page

This page includes the animation controls parameters of FBX within TouchDesigner.

Animation `animation` - Specifies the animation name (if any is specified) to playback from the imported FBX.
Shift Animation Start `shiftanimationstart` - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the importing file.
Sample Rate Mode `sampleratemode` - ⊞ - Select between using the 'File FPS' embedded in the FBX file or setting a 'Custom' sample rate.

* File FPS `filefps` -

Sample Rate `samplerate` - Set the sample rate when the "Sample Rate Mode" parameter above is set to 'Custom'.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - A menu to specify the method used to play the animation.

* Locked to Timeline `lockedtotimeline` - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline. The parameters Play, Speed, Index, Cue and Cue Point, are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to animation position.

* Specify Index `specifyindex` - This mode allows the user to specify a particular index (position) in the animation using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the animation.

* Sequential `sequential` - This mode continually plays regardless of the timeline position (the Index parameter is disabled). Play, Speed, Cue, and Cue Point parameters below are enabled to allow some control. The default is set to this value.

Initialize `initialize` - Resets the animation to its initial state.
Start `start` - Resets the animation to its initial state and starts playback.
Cue `cue` - Jumps to and holds at the Cue Point when set to 1. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.

Index Unit `indexunit` - ⊞ -

Speed `speed` - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is Sequential. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on. Negative values will play backwards.
Trim `trim` - A toggle to enable the Trim Start and Trim End parameters.
Trim Start `tstart` - Sets an in point from the beginning of the animation, allowing you to trim the starting index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).
Trim Start Unit `tstartunit` - ⊞ - Specifies a unit type for Trim Start. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.

Trim End `tend` - Sets an end point from the end of the movie, allowing you to trim the ending index of the animation. The units’ menu on the right let you specify this position by index, frames, seconds, or fraction (percentage).
Trim End Unit `tendunit` - ⊞ - Specifies a unit type for Trim End. Changing this will convert the previous unit to the selected unit.

Extend Left `textendleft` - ⊞ - Determines how the animation behaves before the start of the animation (or Trim Start position if it is used).

* Cycle `cycle` -

Extend Right `textendright` - ⊞ - Determines how the animation behaves after the end of the animation (or Trim End position if it is used).

# Feedback CHOP

The Feedback CHOP stores channels from the current frame to be used in a later frame, without forcing recooking back one frame. It allows you to get the state of a CHOP as it was one frame or time slice ago.

For example, if you need the position or speed of an object from a frame ago in order to compute its position, displacement or speed at the current frame, you would select a CHOP containing those values, and it will output it a frame or time slice later.

CHOPs like the [Lag CHOP](Lag_CHOP.html "Lag CHOP") and [Filter CHOP](Filter_CHOP.html "Filter CHOP") look back in time (iterate) internal to the CHOP, but sometimes the output of a chain of CHOPs is needed as the input of the same chain one frame later.

It allows connecting CHOPs in circular loops without **Infinite Recursion** errors. It simply copies its input without cooking it first.

Feedback TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Feedback TOP

The Feedback TOP can be used to create feedback effects in TOPs. It can give fake motion blur by not clearing the color buffer. The Feedback TOP's input image will be passed through whenever Feedback is bypassed (by setting the Bypass Feedback parameter = 1). When feedback is activated (Bypass Feedback parameter = 0) the Feedback TOP will output an image stream sourced from its Target TOP. By selecting a Target TOP downstream in the feedback network, other filter TOPs can be added in between the Feedback TOP and its Target TOP to achive feedback effects. See the example networks below.

See [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") for some examples on how to use the Feedback TOP.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[feedbackTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FeedbackTOP_Class "FeedbackTOP Class")

Target TOP `top` - Specifies a TOP for feedback to use as its source when activated.
Reset `reset` - Activates feedback when set to 0. Disables feedback when set to 1. When disabled, the Feedback TOP passes thru the image connected to its input.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Resets the feedback in a single frame when clicked.

Render Cursor `fieldcursor` - Toggle this setting to turn on and off the cursor display in the field.
Focus Order `fieldfocus` - The path to a DAT with a list of field component focus orders. The DAT should container a list of paths relative to the DAT parent in the focus order.

When the user hits <tab> or <shift+tab> the focus will automatically be set to the field before or after the entry
for this field. If the path for this field is not specified in focus order table, the focus will remain unchanged.

Fillet SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Fillet SOP

The Fillet SOP is used to create smooth bridging geometry between two curves / polygons or two surfaces / meshes.

Filleting creates a new primitive between each input pair and never affects the original shapes. This is in contrast to the [Join](Join_SOP.html "Join SOP") and [Stitch SOPs](Stitch_SOP.html "Stitch SOP"). The [Join SOP](Join_SOP.html "Join SOP") converts and possibly changes the connected ends of primitives, and stitching changes the original shapes but does not change the number of resulting primitives.

Please refer to the [Align SOP](Align_SOP.html "Align SOP") for a discussion of "left" and "right" primitives as well as the option of an auxiliary input.

Note: Trim curves are not taken into account by a fillet. To do this, use the Join SOP.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[filletSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FilletSOP_Class "FilletSOP Class")

Group `group` - Which primitives to fillet. If blank, it fillets the entire input. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Fillet `fillet` - ⊞ - Can optionally fillet subgroups of N primitives or every nth primitive in a cyclical manner.

**Example**: Assume there are six primitives numbered for 0 - 5, and N = 2. Then:

1. Groups will fillet 0-1 2-3 4-5
2. Skipping will fillet 0-2-6 and 1-3-5.

N `inc` - Determines the number of primitives to be either grouped or skipped.
Wrap Last to First `loop` - Connects the beginning of the first primitive to the end of the last primitive filleted, or, if only one primitive exists, it creates a fillet between its ends.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - This menu determines the parametric direction of the filleting operation, which can be in U or in V, and is meaningful only when the inputs are surfaces. The U direction is associated with columns; the V direction refers to rows.

* in U `ujoin` -

* in V `vjoin` -

Fillet Type `fillettype` - ⊞ - Select which type of fillet to use in this menu.

* Freeform `freeform` - Allows full specifications of the fillet.

* Convex `convex` - May negate scale values to ensure convex fillets.

* Circular `circular` - Attempts to build a fillet as close to a radial arc as the shape and orientation of the inputs permit. You do not need to specify a radius - it is automatically determined to ensure a smooth connection between the inputs. As the two inputs come into proximity of each other, the fillet radius decreases. The tangent scales are ignored (as in the [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP")); only the sign of the tangent is taken into account in order to save you from needing to flip the normals of either input.

Primitive Type `primtype` - ⊞ - Select what type of primitive will be created by the fillet in this menu.

* Input Geometry Type `input` - Builds a fillet of the matching type between pairs of primitives. If the pair of primitives are different types, then the most general type is used (i.e. NURBS over Bzier, Bzier over polygons).

* Polygon `polygon` - Builds a polygonal fillet between pairs of primitives.

* NURBS `nurbs` - Builds a NURBS fillet between pairs of primitives at the given order.

* Bezier `bezier` - Builds a Bzier fillet between pairs of primitives at the given order.

Order `order` - Order at which to build the spline fillets.
Left UV `leftuv` - ⊞ - Parametric point on each left primitive at which to begin the fillet.

* `leftuv1` -

* `leftuv2` -

Right UV `rightuv` - ⊞ - Parametric point on each right primitive at which to begin the fillet.

* `rightuv1` -

* `rightuv2` -

LR Width `lrwidth` - ⊞ - The first value represents the proportion of the left primitive that the left end of the fillet spans. The second value represents the proportion of the right primitive that the right end of the fillet spans.

* `lrwidth1` -

* `lrwidth2` -

LR Scale `lrscale` - ⊞ - Use to control the direction and scale of the first and last segments of the fillet.

* `lrscale1` -

* `lrscale2` -

LR Offset `lroffset` - ⊞ - Controls the position of the first and last segments of the fillet.

* `lroffset1` -

* `lroffset2` -

Match Input to Fillets `seamless` - If selected, then the inputs are modified in such a way that the isoparms appear continuous from one primitive, through the fillet to the other primitive. Also, the primitives are promoted to the same type and order. This will minimize if not eliminate any artifacts introduced in rendering at the cost of more refined geometry.
Cut Primitives `cut` - If selected, the primitives are trimmed at the point the fillet begins.

Filter CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Filter CHOP

The Filter CHOP smooths or sharpens the input channels. It filters by combining each sample and a range of its neighbor samples to set the new value of that sample. Each filter type uses its own weighting factors for the neighboring samples. The Filter Width determines the number of neighbors to use.

The default Gaussian filter nicely smooths out data, typically with a Filter Width around .3 seconds. The Box Filter is interesting when your inputs are step changes to new values: the values linearly interpolate to the new value.

It is useful to follow the Filter CHOP with a [Trail CHOP](Trail_CHOP.html "Trail CHOP") and connect the filtered and pre-filtered signal to its inputs.

If you want to pass one or more channels in, each with multi-samples, and you want to filter each sample as if each sample was its own filter, turn on the Filter per Sample parameter.

For a similar, more-abrupt effect, see the [Lag CHOP](Lag_CHOP.html "Lag CHOP").

The Filter CHOP can filter both motion and sound, but other CHOPs are more appropriate for filtering sound (see the [Audio Filter CHOP](Audio_Filter_CHOP.html "Audio Filter CHOP"), [Band EQ CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Band_EQ_CHOP "Band EQ CHOP"), and [Parametric EQ CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Parametric_EQ_CHOP "Parametric EQ CHOP")).

## Notes on the One Euro Filter[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Filter_CHOP&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Notes on the One Euro Filter")]

The one Euro Filter is especially useful when a person is in an interaction loop with TouchDeigner and wants quick response: It responds quickly to large changes in value, and it smooths out jitters in the input:

* Cutoff Frequency: Decrease it if slow speed jitter is a problem.
* Slope Cutoff Frequency: Avoids high derivative bursts caused by jitter. (The research paper implementation fixes this value to 1Hz but defaults to )
* Speed Coefficient: Increase if high speed lag is a problem.

The 1 € filter ("one Euro filter") is a simple algorithm to filter noisy signals for high precision and responsiveness. It uses a first order low-pass filter with an adaptive cutoff frequency: at low speeds, a low cutoff stabilizes the signal by reducing jitter, but as speed increases, the cutoff is increased to reduce lag. The algorithm is easy to implement, uses very few resources, and with two easily understood parameters, it is easy to tune. In a comparison with other filters, the 1 € filter has less lag using a reference amount of jitter reduction. (researchgate.net)

Here is a procedure to tune the One Euro filter:
First Speed Coefficient is set to 0 and Cutoff Frequency to a reasonable middle-ground value such as 1 Hz. Then the body part is held steady or moved at a very low speed while Slope Cutoff Frequency is adjusted to remove jitter and preserve an acceptable lag during these slow movements (decreasing Slope Cutoff Frequency reduces jitter but increases lag, Slope Cutoff Frequency must be > 0). Next, the body part is moved quickly in different directions while Speed Coefficient is increased with a focus on minimizing lag. First find the right order of magnitude to tune Speed Coefficient, which depends on the kind of data you manipulate and their units: do not hesitate to start with values like 0.001 or 0.0001. You can first multiply and divide Speed Coefficient by factor 10 until you notice an effect on latency when moving quickly. Note that parameters Speed Coefficient and Speed Coefficient have clear conceptual relationships: if high speed lag is a problem, increase Speed Coefficient. If slow speed jitter is a problem, decrease Slope Cutoff Frequency.

reference: Casiez, G., Roussel, N. and Vogel, D. (2012). 1€ Filter: A Simple Speed-based Low-pass Filter for Noisy Input in Interactive Systems

Type `type` - ⊞ - There are seven types of filters:

* Gaussian `gauss` - This filter has a Gaussian (normal or "bell" curve) shape that smooths the channel. It acts as a low pass filter. The wider the filter, the lower the cutoff frequency, resulting in smoother data.

* Left Half Gaussian `halfgauss` - This produces a lag on the channel. If the input channels represent values over time, this filter is seen as only using samples back in time from the current sample. For time-data, this is more realistic as you can't look ahead in time. (Maybe some day.) It has a half-bell shape.

* Box `box` - This filter is box-shaped, meaning that each neighbor sample it uses has the same weighting factor. It can produce unwanted steps in the output channel because the effect of the samples at the extremes of the filter don't fade out as the window slides over the samples. It low-pass filters data, similar to the Gaussian filter.

NOTE: When using Gaussian or Box filtering, the channel is delayed by half the filter size (i.e. a Filter Size of 30 samples will delay the output by 15 samples). To eliminate this delay, use either a Left Half Gaussian or a Left Half Box filter. Applying a Sharpen or Edge Detect filter always delays the output by half the filter size. Applying a Despike filter will delay the output by the full filter size.

* Left Half Box `halfbox` - This filter produces a lag on the data, uses only samples back in time, and otherwise acts like a box filter.

* Edge Detect `edge` - This filter detects "edges", sharp changes in the input channels. It acts as a high pass filter. As the filter width is increased, more low frequencies are added.

* Sharpen `sharpen` - This filter sharpens all high frequencies. It is the sum of the edge detect result and the original data.

* De-spike `despike` - This filter removes "spikes" (samples more than `Spike Tolerance' above or below the expected sample value). The filter width allows you to eliminate spikes that are several samples long. Wide filters will remove wide spikes (spikes of several samples) and small filters will only remove narrow spikes (one or two samples in length).

* Ramp Preserve `ramp` - This filter attempts to output an increasing ramp that increases at the 'Ramp Rate' parameter rate. The input channel to the Filter CHOP should be increasing at this rate, with possibly some errors/noise in it. The Ramp Preserve will ignore the input channel unless the difference between the input value and the current ramp value is larger than 'Ramp Tolerance' parameter. When the difference becomes greater than the tolerance, the ramp will reset to start at the current input value.

* One Euro `oneeuro` - This filter is good for filtering noisy signals while maintaining high precision and resposiveness.

Effect `effect` - The extent to which the filter affects the channel (0 - not at all, 1 - maximum effect).
Filter Width `width` - The amount of surrounding samples used in the calculation of the current sample. It is expressed in the Units.
Filter Width Unit `widthunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Spike Tolerance `spike` - For the De-spike filter type, this is the amount that a sample can differ from its neighbours without being considered a spike.
Ramp Tolerance `ramptolerance` - When using a Ramp Preserve filter, if the input value deviates from the current output ramp value by this much, then the ramp will reset to the new input value. Otherwise the Ramp Preserve will continue climbing at the specified 'Ramp Rate'.
Ramp Rate `ramprate` - When using a Ramp Preserve filter, this is the rate that the CHOP's output channel will increase. Only if the input channel value deviates from the desired output value by 'Ramp Tolerance' amount will the CHOP instead output the input channel value.
Number of Passes `passes` - The number of times the filter is applied to the channel.
Filter per Sample `filterpersample` - Applies the filter to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.
Cutoff Frequency (Hz) `cutoff` - Decrease it if slow speed jitter is a problem.
Speed Coefficient `speedcoeff` - Increase if high speed lag is a problem.
Slope Cutoff Frequency (Hz) `slopecutoff` - Avoids high derivative bursts caused by jitter.
Reset `reset` - When On resets (bypasses) the filter effect.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets the filter effect.

A powerful feature of CHOPs that filter over time, like the [Lag CHOP](Lag_CHOP.html "Lag CHOP") and Filter CHOP where each sample acts as its own filter.

Fit SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Fit SOP

The Fit SOP fits a Spline curve to a sequence of points or a Spline surface to an m X n mesh of points.

Any type of face or surface represents a valid input. The Fit SOP looks only at the control vertices (CVs) of the primitives, treating the CVs as data points to run the fit through. For example, if a cubic NURBS surface and a mesh have the same number of rows and columns and identical points, they will yield an identical fit because the Spline bases of the input NURBS surface are ignored.

The Fit SOP generates two types of outputs: primitives that roughly follow the path of the data points without necessarily going through the data points; and primitives that touch all the data points. The first type, known as "approximation", is used primarily to extract a lean, smooth shape from a heavy data set, lending itself well to data reduction. The second type, known as "interpolation", often serves as a smoothing tool for paths that must go through specified target positions.

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

## Parameters - Fit Page

This is the main page of the SOP. Its purpose is to specify the type of fitting and the characteristics of the output primitive.

Method `method` - ⊞ - Specifies one of two fitting styles: approximation or interpolation. Each style has a number of parameters that are accessible from the respective folder. For more information see the Approximation and Interpolation pages below.

* Approximation `approx` -

* Interpolation `interp` -

Primitive Type `type` - ⊞ - The output of the Fit SOP is a NURBS or Bzier primitive. All input faces are fitted to Spline curves, and all input surfaces are fitted to spline surfaces. The resulting shapes are identical whether created as NURBS or as Bzier primitives.

* NURBS `nurbs` -

* Bezier `bezier` -

Connectivity `surftype` - ⊞ - This option is used to select the type of surface, when using a Mesh Primitive Type.

* Rows and Columns `rowcol` - Both Rows and Columns. Looks like Quads in wire frame display, but all polygons are open (if the primitive type is polygon).

U Order `orderu` - If the input is a face, this is the order of the Spline curve to be generated. If the input is a surface, this is the order of the fitted spline surface in the U parametric direction.
V Order `orderv` - If the input is a surface, this is the order of the fitted Spline surface in the V parametric direction. The V order is irrelevant if the input is a face.

## Parameters - Approximation Page

Approximation fitting is used primarily to generate a lean, smooth shape from a dense data set. The result is a primitive that approximates the positions and attributes of the data points but does not necessarily touch these points. The only points the fitted curve or surface goes through are the end-points of the data set. If the fitted primitive is required to go through all the points, fitting by interpolation is the answer.

The approximation fit is capable of producing very reasonable shapes with far fewer control vertices than the number of data points. Although the result is unlikely to match the original shape identically, it can come very close to it, depending on the parameters it is set to. For this reason, approximation fitting is often used as a data reduction tool and performs best when the size of the data set is large.

The fitted primitives are generated open or wrapped based on the "open" property of the inputs. For best results, the input primitives should be open.

Tolerance `tol` - This is the primary precision factor in approximation fitting. The smaller the tolerance, the closer the fit and the higher the number of generated vertices. If a small tolerance causes unwanted twists or contortions in the fitted primitive, it may help to vary the Spline order and/or enable the Multiple Knots flag.
Smoothness `smooth` - For a set tolerance, the smoothness factor allows for more or less roundness in the generated shape. If this parameter is zero, it does not mean that the fit will be sharp. It simply indicates that no additional smoothing is required past the level of smoothness already achieved with the given tolerance.
U Multiple Knots `multipleu` - Sometimes the data set has sharp bends that must be preserved in the fitted shape. In this case, inserting multiple knots in the areas of sharp curvature will usually produce the right effect. Sometimes, however, the simulated sharpness induces unwanted twists immediately before or after the corner. Lowering the Spline order and/or reducing the tolerance may help diminish this side-effect.
V Multiple Knots `multiplev` - Sometimes the data set has sharp bends that must be preserved in the fitted shape. In this case, inserting multiple knots in the areas of sharp curvature will usually produce the right effect. Sometimes, however, the simulated sharpness induces unwanted twists immediately before or after the corner. Lowering the Spline order and/or reducing the tolerance may help diminish this side-effect.

## Parameters - Interpolation Page

Interpolation fitting is used primarily to generate a shape that goes through (i.e. interpolates) a complete set of data points and their attributes. As opposed to approximation fitting, interpolation thrives on small data sets. Moreover, unlike the approximation method, this one does not produce a leaner structure than the input it fits. In certain cases it even generates a higher CV count than its input. For this reason, the use of interpolation fitting should be limited to those cases where point interpolation is paramount, such as building precise animation paths.

Scope `scope` - ⊞ - Scope establishes the interpolation method.

* Global `global` - Global interpolation take the whole data set into account at once and generates exactly as many CVs as data points is it given.

* Local (Curves Only) `local` - Local interpolation takes a more geometric approach, building the curve or surface one span at a time, using only local data at each step. The local method generates more CVs than the number of data points it is given, but it usually yields a tighter fit than the global method. The local approach is also less computationally expensive than the global one, and handles cusps and local perturbations better. Local interpolation is available only for curves.

* Breakpoints `breakpnt` - Breakpoint interpolation is a variant of global interpolation that satisfies the requirement that the locations of data points coincide with the breakpoints of the generated curve. The breakpoints of a Spline curve are the image of the Spline basis on the curve. Breakpoint interpolation is available only for curves.

U Data Parameter `dataparmu` - ⊞ - Specifies the parameterization of the data in the U direction (the only direction if the input is a curve). The data parameterization can be uniform, chord length, or centripetal.
Uniform Uniform parameterization uses equally spaced parameter values. It works best when the geometry is very regular. When the data is unevenly spaced, this approach can produce very unintuitive shapes, and is not recommended.
Chord Length Chord length computes the parameterization of the data based on the relative distances between successive data points. It is the most commonly used approach because is tends to produce the most accurate results.
Centripetal Centripetal parameterization is similar to chord length, but yields better results when the data has very sharp corners.

* Chord Length `chrdlen` -

* Centripetal `centrip` -

V Data Parameter `dataparmv` - ⊞ - V data parameterization is identical to U data parameterization, but it affects the V direction when the input is a surface. It is not used when the input is a face.

U Wrap `closeu` - ⊞ - This menu determines whether the fitted curve should be closed, or whether the fitted surface should be wrapped in the U parametric direction. The options are to open (Off), close (On), or inherit the closure type from the input primitive.

* Off `nonewu` -

* On `wu` -

* If Primitive does `ifprimwu` -

V Wrap `closev` - ⊞ - This menu determines whether the fitted surface should be wrapped in the V parametric direction. The options are to open (Off), close (On), or inherit the closure type from the input primitive. V Wrap is ignored when the input is a face.

* Off `nonewv` -

* On `wv` -

* If Primitive does `ifprimwv` -

Fit Corners `corners` - Specifies whether corners in the data should be preserved when doing local curve interpolation.

Fit TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Fit TOP

The Fit TOP re-sizes its input to the resolution set on the Common Page using the method specified in the Fit parameter menu. This is useful for changing the aspect ratio of an image without distorting it horizontally or vertically. It will crop the image or fill with the background color depending on the Fit parameter options.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[fitTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FitTOP_Class "FitTOP Class")

Fit `fit` - ⊞ - Determines how the input is fit to the specified resolution.

* Fill `fill` - The input is stretched/squashed to fill the resolution and aspect ratio specified on the Common page.

* Fit Horizontal `fithorz` - The input is uniformly scaled to fit horizontally.

* Fit Vertical `fitvert` - The input is uniformly scaled to fit vertically.

* Fit Best `fitbest` - The input is uniformly scaled to fit using the best possible match that does not crop any of the input. It's a "fit inside". The aspect ratio of the input is maintained.

* Fit Outside `fitoutside` - This is the opposite of Fit Best. It is uniformly scaled so the input covers the specified resolution completely.

* Native Resolution `nativeres` - The input is not scaled. If the specified resolution is smaller than the input, it is cropped.

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your TOP will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - The two fields for Translate and Scale allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes. The field for Rotate allow you to specify the amount of rotation.

Translate Unit `tunit` - Sets the units used in the Translate parameter.
Rotate `r` - The field for rotation allows you to specify the amount of rotation of the image.
Scale `s` - ⊞ - The two fields for Scale allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The Pivot point edit fields allow you to define the point about which the TOP scales and rotates. Altering the pivot point of a TOP produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the TOP image.

For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of a TOP image is located at `-1,-1` and you wanted to scale the image by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%), then the TOP would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.

Pivot Unit `punit` - Sets the units used in the Pivot parameter.
Background Color `bgcolor` - ⊞ - Color applied behind the foreground image. The background is visible when the image is translated or scaled down. Try scaling an image down 50% in size (Scale = 0.5,0.5) and setting the background color.

Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.
Legacy Transform `legacyxform` - When enabled, will use the legacy method of building the transform matrix, which has inverted rotation and transform order.

Font SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Font SOP

**Note**: Font SOP deprecated build 2019.14650, use [Text SOP](Text_SOP.html "Text SOP").

The Font SOP allows you to create text in your model from Adobe Type 1 Postscript Fonts.

To install fonts, copy the font files to the `$TFS/touch/fonts` directory of your installation path. They will be ready to be used in the Font SOP after restarting TouchDesigner.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[fontSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FontSOP_Class "FontSOP Class")

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Page](#Parameters_-_Page)

Primitive Type `type` - ⊞ - Select from the following types. For information on the different types, see the Geometry Types section. Bzier Curves and Polygons provide the most efficient use of memory, because they use polygons for letters containing straight segments, and Bzier curves for all others.

**Note:** Due to an Open GL bug, holes in Bzier fonts may shade incorrectly.

* Bezier Curves and Polygons `bezierpoly` -

* Beziers Only `bezier` -

* Polygons Only `poly` -

Font `file` - Choose the font to create the text. By clicking on the + button a File Dialog will appear, and clicking menu drop down brings up a menu of the most used fonts.
Text `text` - Enter the text you want to generate here.

Your text can contain the following special characters:

* `\`  - Take the next character literally (so you can use the / and ` characters in your text);
* ``string``  - Evaluate the string contained by the backquotes (above the T key) as an expression;
* `\n`  - Start a new line;
* `\xxx`  - Specify a character by it's ascii code (e.g. \007).

**For Example:** If you put something like `\\$F3` in the text string, you should see all the possible characters of a font as you play the animation (set the last frame to 256).

**Entering Expressions as Text** - You can also use expressions for the text.

**For Example:** `me.time.frame` - will display the current frame.

`op('null1')['chan1']` - will display the current value of channel chan1 in CHOP `null1`.

`'hello world'[int(me.time.frame)%11]` - causes the eleven letters of the text to appear in succession during the first eleven frames.

**Other Methods of Entering Text -** You can use the `\xxx` decimal notation to specify characters. The available characters will depend on the font type used.

**For Example:** \065 - will display '`a`'.

You can also use the [Par Class](Par_Class.html "Par Class") to set text in the Font SOP. This can be done from the textport, a [Logic CHOP](Logic_CHOP.html "Logic CHOP") or [Expression CHOP](Expression_CHOP.html "Expression CHOP"), or any script. (See [Scripting](Introduction_to_Python_Tutorial.html "Introduction to Python Tutorial") articles)

**For Example:** `op('font1').par.text = 'hello world'` - will display the words: hello world

Center Text Horizontally `hcenter` - This check box allows you to center the text horizontally about X = 0.
Center Text Vertically `vcenter` - This check box allows you to center the text vertically about Y = 0.
Translate `t` - ⊞ - Translates the geometry in x, y and z.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - Scales the text in the X and Y axis.

Kerning `kern` - ⊞ - Letter spacing in the X direction. Line spacing in the Y direction if there are multiple lines. If you need manual character-by-character, you can do it in Model mode.

* X `kernx` -

* Y `kerny` -

Italic Angle `italic` - Doesn't actually give an italic version of the font, but rather obliques the text by shearing it the specified number of degrees. A negative number makes the text slant to the left.
Level of Detail `lod` - Adobe fonts are defined by Bzier curves. If polygons only is selected, the Font SOP converts these to polygons. This value adjusts the number of points in the polygons that it gets converted to.
Hole Faces `hole` - Generates holes in polygons and Bzier faces.
Texture Coordinates `texture` - ⊞ - This adds uv coordinates to the geometry created by the Font SOP.

* Off `off` - No uv coordinates added.

* Orthographic `ortho` - Orthographic uv coordinates added.

Force COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Force COMP

Force COMPs are used to added forces to a physics solver's simulation. [Bullet](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") supports linear/rotational forces and impulse forces (see Force page) and [Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex "Flex") supports force fields (see Force Field page).

### Active Force

Active forces are enabled using the Active toggle parameter on the Force page.

An active force will create a force in the simulation that is applied over time. An active force can either be applied globally by being referenced on the [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP"), or it can be applied locally by being referenced on an individual [Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP"). The active force applies its force each frame, and the force applied over 1 second is equivalent to an impulse force of the same value applied in a single frame.

The units for the force and torque parameters are in Newtons (N), equivalent to kg\*m/s^2. This means that if a force of 10N is applied to an actor with mass equal to 5kg and no initial velocity, then after 1 second the velocity of that actor will be 2m/s => 10N / 5kg \* 1 sec = 2m/s. If all the parameters were the same, but instead it was an impulse force, then the velocity would still be 2m/s. However, the impulse force's velocity would change instantaneously and stop increasing (unless pulsed again) whereas with the active force the velocity will continue to increase after 1 second.

The center of mass is assumed to be center of the bounding box of the mass. By default, if a body is not constrained and not colliding, the force will not cause the body to rotate, unless the Relative Position parameter is set to a non-zero value. If Relative Position is set to +1 in X and the force is +1 in Y, it will cause the body to rotate counter-clockwise around the Z-axis and translate in Y.

If the Torque is set to +1 in Z, it will cause the body to only rotate counter-clockwise in the Z-axis (a positive Z rotation), and not translate.

To apply force/torque to specific bodies use a Feedback CHOP (see [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP") or [Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP")) and **force[xyz]** and **torque[xyz]** channels.

### Impulse Force

Impulse forces are applied through the Impulse Force pulse parameter.

An impulse force pulse will create a force in the simulation that is applied for 1 frame. In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in [Bullet](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.

The resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as an active force with the same values if the active force is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of impulse force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg \* 1sec = 2m/s.

### Force Field

Force fields are enabled through the Active parameter on the Force Field page.

Force fields are spherical with a radius defined through the Radius parameter. Positive strength pushes bodies outward and negative strength pulls bodies inward.

Force SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Force SOP

The Force SOP adds force attributes to the input metaball field that is used by either [Particle SOP](Particle_SOP.html "Particle SOP") or [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html "Spring SOP") as attractor or repulsion force fields. In general, force values greater than 0 cause points to be attracted, less than 0 cause points to be repelled.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[forceSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ForceSOP_Class "ForceSOP Class")

Radial Force `doradial` - When checked, triggers a force towards or away from the centre of the metaball field, depending on the value of the force.
Force `radial` - When Radial Force is checked, this controls the strength of the Radial Force field.
Directional Force `doaxis` - When checked, enables all parameters below to allow control of specific force attributes.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - When Directional Force is checked, determines the direction vector axis, and activates forces along the directional vector for the directional forces below.

Axial Force `axial` - When Directional Force is checked, controls the force along the primary axis. Increasing this value will cause the particles to move up the primary axis of the metaball field as defined by the direction vector.
Vortex Force `vortex` - When Directional Force is checked, this field controls the amount of twist particles are given around the primary axis. Positive values cause the particles to spin clockwise, negative values cause counter-clockwise spins. It is a centrifugal force.
Spiral Force `spiral` - Controls the attraction/repulsion force perpendicular to the primary axis (Direction field). Values greater than 0 will cause the points to be drawn toward the primary axis. Values less than 0 push particles away perpendicular to the primary axis. It is a tangential force.

To view the metaball field of influence, turn on the hulls display of the input metaball/s object/s. Both the [Particle SOP](Particle_SOP.html "Particle SOP") and [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html "Spring SOP") will display these hulls as guide geometry.

Adjust the weights of the metaball inputs to increase or decrease the field effect within the metaball field of influence.

In general, it is a good idea to try and keep the scale of forces and force fields to a smaller rather than a larger scale. This tends to make particle movement and attraction more manageable and realistic.

Fractal SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Fractal SOP

The Fractal SOP allows you created jagged mountain-like divisions of the input geometry. It will create random-looking deviations and sub-divisions along either a specified normal vector (the Direction xyz fields) or the vertex normals of the input geometry. This is great for the creation of terrains and landscapes.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[fractalSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/FractalSOP_Class "FractalSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Divisions `divs` - The number of subdivisions of the input geometry. Values in the range of 1 - 3 are reasonable to start with. Higher values cause excessive geometry and should be used with caution.
Smoothness `smooth` - The smoothness value scales the deviations. The range is usually between 0 and 1, and small numbers create larger deviations than large numbers. Smoothness and Scale have a similar effect, but there is a subtle difference. Smoothness is calculated for each iteration of the SOP. The number of Iterations is, in turn set by the number of Divisions. Scale, by contrast, is a global scaling of the amplitude of the deviations, with no consideration of the stage at which they are created. Using low values of smoothness (producing large deviations) and a small scale value will give a slightly more random looking result than doing the opposite; high roughness values (small deviations) and large scale values, providing Divisions is greater than 1.
Scale `scale` - Global setting of the fractal divisions. See the above discussion about Smoothness vs. Scale.
Seed `seed` - The random seed used for fractalising. Specifying a different integer value gives a different shape.
Fixed Boundary `fixed` - When enabled, this option prevents Fractal from applying any deviations to the edges (boundaries) so that you could, for example, fractalise a plane and still be able to connect the edges of the plane to the sides of the box. This is achieved by first refining the surface between all breakpoints, and then fractalized.
Use Vertex Normals `vtxnms` - Instead of using the Direction fields below, this sets the direction of the fractalisation at any given point to be the direction of the vertex normals of the input. This may be preferable when using a sphere or other rounded object as the input, as the deviations will originate from the center of the sphere instead of all being the same direction.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - The direction of the Fractalisation. The default values of `0, 0, 1` make the fractal deviations point in the Z direction. Can be overridden by: Use Vertex Normals.

# FreeD In CHOP

From Derivative
(Redirected from [FreeD CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=FreeD_CHOP&redirect=no "FreeD CHOP"))

The FreeD CHOP reads incoming camera tracking data sent over a network using the FreeD protocol and outputs CHOP channels that can be used to control a virtual 3D camera. FreeD is not exclusive to any particular tracking system, but is frequenty used as an interchange protocol since it is supported by a wide range of hardware and software. However, as an older standard, it is lower precision and does not contain len distortion data like [Stype](Stype_In_CHOP.html "Stype In CHOP") or [Ncam](Ncam_CHOP.html "Ncam CHOP"), so it is recommended to use the hardware specific protocol when possible. Examples of hardware and software that support FreeD are [Viz Virtual Studio](https://www.vizrt.com/products/viz-virtual-studio) and [Panasonic PTZ cameras.](https://na.panasonic.com/us/ar-vr-virtual-set-production-with-panasonic-robotic-ptz-camera)

The channels exported by the FreeD CHOP are:

*camera\_id* - a number from 0 - 255 that can be used to store an id number for the camera
*tx, ty, tz* - camera position, can be connected to the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") Translate parameters
*rx, ry, rz* - camera rotation, can be connected to the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") Rotate parameters
*focus* - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the focus ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.
*zoom* - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the zoom ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.
*user* - a 16-bit positive integer (0 - 65k) that can be used by the camera system to send custom user-defined data

**Note:** The FreeD CHOP only processes the 'D1' camera position and orientation message that is part of the FreeD protocol. All other message types will be ignored.

If the incoming network stream contains data for more than one camera, the Camera ID parameter can be used to select data from only one camera. If the Camera ID parameter is blank, then whatever data is received most recently will be shown - this could result in the data switching between cameras.

For more information or to diagnose connection problems, an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") can be connected to see if any packets have been dropped, skipped, or filtered out.

FreeD Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# FreeD Out CHOP

The FreeD Out CHOP sends camera tracking information, including position and orientation, to an external device or program over the network using the popular device-indepedent FreeD protocol. This can be used to emulate a physical camera or to send data to another program/device that can process FreeD tracking data. Data packets are sent out once per frame based on the current data in the CHOP channels. If one of the expected channels is not found in the input, then a default value will be sent. FreeD data can be received from other devices using the corresponding [FreeD In CHOP](FreeD_In_CHOP.html "FreeD In CHOP").

The channels used by the FreeD Out CHOP are:

*camera\_id* - a number from 0 - 255 that can be used to store an id number for the camera
*tx, ty, tz* - camera position, can be connected to the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") Translate parameters. Values can range from +/- 131.07m.
*rx, ry, rz* - camera rotation, can be connected to the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") Rotate parameters. Values can range from +/- 256 degrees.
*focus* - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the focus ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.
*zoom* - a 24-bit positive integer (0-16 million) in arbitrary units that relates to the zoom ring on a camera lens. Applications can interpret this value according to the hardware in use.
*user* - a 16-bit positive integer (0 - 65k) that can be used by the camera system to send custom user-defined data

**Note:** The FreeD Out CHOP sends the 'D1' camera position and orientation message that is part of the FreeD protocol.

# Function CHOP

The Function CHOP provides more complicated math functions than found in the [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") : trigonometic functions, logarithmic functions and exponential functions, and also audio decibels (dB)-power-amplitude conversions.

Most of the functions require only one parameter, and they are applied as a unary operator to each input channel. Some functions take two parameters, and these require the use of the second input. The first parameter, X, is always a value from a channel in the first input. The second parameter, Y, is a value from a corresponding channel in the second input. Channels from each input are paired by name or index.

Since many of these functions can produce math errors, an error handling tab is provided for error handling and recovery.
Errors can be handled by replacing the bad sample with a pre-defined value or by using the value of the previous sample. Alternatively, cooking can be aborted upon error for debugging networks.

Function types in decibels: as you would employ for audio or other signal strengths. -10dB means 1/10 the power, -20dB means 1/100 the power. It turns out that each 3dB means almost exactly double the power, so +12dB is 2\*2\*2\*2 = 16 times the power. Power is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So -20dB means 1/10 the amplitude, and 6dB is double the amplitude.

Function TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Function TOP

The Function TOP can perform mathematical operations like sin, cos, or exp on the color values of the input image. Different functions can be performed on each color channel. Some functions will take an additional value from the Base, Exponent or Constant Value parameters, and some functions take an additional input value from the second input image.

For some functions, you can use the 'Replace Errors' parameter to insert a new value for values that would otherwise be undefined e.g. log(-1)

##### Supported functions:

* *Input* - Pass along the input value unchanged
* *Constant* - Replace the input with the value of the 'Constant' parameter.
* *Square Root* - Find the square root of the input value i.e. sqrt(x).
* *Absolute Value* - Get the absolute value of the input i.e. abs(x).
* *Sign* - Returns -1 if the input value is below 0, 0 if it equals 0, and 1 if it's greater than zero.

* *Log Base N* - Returns the base N logarithm of the input, where N is set by the 'Base Value' parameter.
* *Natural Log* - Returns the natural log of the input i.e. ln(x).
* *Exponent* - Returns e to the power of the input i.e. e^x.
* *Exponent 2* - Returns 2 to the power of the input i.e. 2^x.
* *Exponent 10* - Returns 10 to the power of the input i.e. 10^x.
* *Base Power* - Returns the 'Base Value' parameter to the power of x. 2
* *Input1 ^ Exponent* - Returns the input value to the power of the exponent parameter. 2
* *Input1 ^ Input2* - Returns the value of input 1 to the power of input 2. 2
* *dB to Power* - Converts decibels to power.

Geo Text COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Geo Text COMP

The Geo Text COMP renders text in 3D. It does not read or generate a SOP as it does direct rendering using the [Slug Library](Slug_Library.html "Slug Library") and can be lit and textured with any [MAT](MAT.html "MAT") material.

You can set fonts, colors, sizes, bold, italic, tracking, multi-lines like you can with the [Text COMP](Text_COMP.html "Text COMP"). But because the Geo Text COMP doesn't have a boundary, width or height like the Text COMP, we substitute it with a layout box and the Layout Box parameters. The layout box has a width and height, and by default the bottom left of the layout box is placed at 0,0,0 in 3D space of the Geo Text COMP ("object space"). The Layout Box Anchor U and V let you put the center of the layout box at 0,0,0 by setting the anchors to .5, 5.

The layout box's size although you can't see it by default, is the Layout Box Size parameter. With that you can right-justify or top-justify text in the layout box, and clip to the layout box. You can also pad space aroud each side of the layout box.

See also the 2D equivalent [Text COMP](Text_COMP.html "Text COMP"). See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes "Text Formatting Codes") for ways to override settings per-character.

**Render multiple strings transformed separately**: The Specification DAT and Specification CHOP allow for individual strings to be each positioned and styled independently in 3D.

Every row of the Spec DAT represents a "block" or "text block". Every Spec DAT contains a column named `text` which is the string that overrides the Text parameter.

Most columns override a Geo Text COMP parameter, such as `text`, `tx` and `fontsize`. Some column names noted below have no corresponding parameter.

The Spec CHOP can also specify values per block. When including a Spec CHOP the number of Spec CHOP samples needs to be the same number of rows as the Spec DAT following the first column header.

Parameters that can be overrided include `fontsize`, `fontcolor`, tracking etc., plus all the layout box and alignment parameters. Font/bold/italic are supported as columns as they are separate fonts.

**Transforming text blocks**: The column or channel names can include `tx`, `ty`, `tz` and all the rotate and scale channels (which use the Transform Order parameter).

A special column/channel called `append` can be used, when `append` is `1`, to position one block of text relative to the end of the previous block. Regular transforms are inherited by each appended text block.

Local transforms (`ltx`, `lrz`, etc), can be used to apply additional transforms to a block that are not inherited by appended blocks. If the special column/channel `localxform` is set to '`pre`', then the local transform is applied in world space before the inherited transforms are applied.

**Note** - The Geo Text COMP uses **blending/transparency** to create the glyphs floating in space (Each glyph is a partially transparent rectangle), so to view properly without the enclosing polygons that surround them, you need to ensure they are drawn after other geometry that they are sitting in-front of. This is usually due using the [Draw Priority](#Parameters_-_Render_Page) parameter on the 'Render' parameter page and making the value more negative than the Draw Priority of other objects. All things with the highest draw priority are drawn first, then all things with the same second higher draw priority are drawn second. If the priority is the same between two objects, then the order they are drawn is arbitrary and will possibly change. **Note**: Text within a Spec DAT should be setup so things in the back are earlier in the table than things in the front. It will draw row-by-row from the Spec DAT.

See OP Snippets for further transform options - `relative` and `append`.

The Geo Text COMP is similar to the [Text COMP](Text_COMP.html "Text COMP") which is a 2D [Panel](Panel.html "Panel").

Mode `mode` - ⊞ - Controls where text is generated from. Either from the 'Text' parameter, or a table DAT provided via the 'Specification DAT' parameter.

* Text `text` - The text will be generated using the contents of the 'Text' parameter.

* Specification DAT `specdat` - The text will be generated using rows and channels from the 'Specification DAT' or 'Specification CHOP' parameters.

Text `text` - When in 'Text' mode, this specifies the text that will be rendered.
Specification DAT `specdat` - In this mode, the Text parameter is ignored and data is taken from a DAT table given in the Specification DAT parameter. Each row of the DAT is a separate line of text, which can have different transforms, alignment, color, word wrap settings applied to them. The column headers should match the parameter name which the column is overriding. If a column entry for a particular row is left empty, then the value of the parameter is used instead. This allows a default value to be used for all rows, but allowing select rows to have different settings as needed. Transforms are not overridden, any transform that is given is applied as a pre-transform before the other transforms given by the parameters. Valid columns are currently: `text, tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz, sx, sy, sz, px, py, pz, ltx, lty, ltz, lrx, lry, lrz, lsx, lsy, lsz, lpx, lpy, lpz, fontcolorr, fontcolorg, fontcolorb, fontalpha, alignx, aligny, alignymode, fontsize, tracking, skew, horzstretch, linespacing, wordwrap, layoutsizew, layoutsizeh, layoutanchoru, layoutanchorv, textpaddingl, textpaddingr, textpaddingb, textpaddingt, render, append, localxform`.
Specification CHOP `specchop` - Allows use of CHOP data to set parameters of text blocks defined in the Specification DAT. Each sample of the CHOP corresponds to the data rows in the Specification DAT. Only numerical data such as `tx, ty, rz, fontcolorr`, etc can be provided by the CHOP.
Sort by Depth `sorted` - Only available when using a Specification DAT. When enabled, lines in the specification DAT are rendered from back to front relative to the current camera to allow for proper alpha blending. Note: sorting a large number of text blocks can cause performance issues, so this should only be enabled if regular alpha blending is not sufficient.
Formatting Codes `formatcodes` - Enables the use of formatting codes in the text. For example, the code {#color(255, 0, 0);} will turn all text afterwards on that line red. See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes "Text Formatting Codes") for all available codes.
Parse Escape Sequences `escapeseq` - When enabled, '\t' sequences will be converted to tabs and '\r' or '\n' to line breaks. This feature is only enabled when using the Specification DAT. For Text mode, python expressions should be used when escape sequences are needed.
Smart Punctuation `smartpunct` - Enables the use of smart punctuation. For example, pairs of quotes will be replaced with appropriate angled quotes, 3 periods will be replaced with an ellipses character and two hypens will become an em-dash.
Word Wrap `wordwrap` - Wrap lines of text if they go beyond the width of the layout box.

## Parameters - Font Page

Font `font` - ⊞ - Select the font to be used from the dropdown menu. Available fonts are those that have been registered with the operating system. There may be a delay when selecting fonts that have not been used before as the system creates the necessary intermediate files required for rendering.

Bold `bold` - Display the text in **bold**.
Italic `italic` - Display the text in *italics*.
Font Size `fontsize` - The font size. This is in the same units as the geometry space. So it's arbitrary based on the size of your scene.
Tracking `tracking` - Sets the horizontal spacing between characters, where 0 is default spacing, > 0 is increased spacing and < 0 is decreased spacing.
Skew `skew` - Tilts the top of the characters forwards or backwards relative to the baseline.
Horz Stretch `horzstretch` - Horizontally stretch the characters relative to their current alignment.
Line Spacing `linespacing` - Adjust spacing between lines. The value is a multiplier of the default spacing defined by the font.

Font Alpha `fontalpha` - The alpha value for the font.
Layout Box Anchor U `layoutanchoru` - Along with the Layout Box Anchor V, this allows shifting the layout box from it's current position left/down. It also controls how rotations will pivot around the layout box, so a 0.5, 0.5 anchor will cause rotations to move about the center of the layout box.
Layout Box Anchor V `layoutanchorv` - The V component of the Layout Box Anchor pair.
Layout Box Size `layoutsize` - ⊞ - Text is aligned and word-wrapped within a virtual layout box. This box is what is transformed by the various transform parameters, and then the text is aligned and laid out within that. The width and height units are the same units as the font size.

* Layout Box Size `layoutsizew` -

* Layout Box Size `layoutsizeh` -

Clip to Layout Box `cliptolayoutbox` - When enabled, text that falls outside of the layout box will not be drawn.

Horizontal Align `alignx` - ⊞ - Controls the horizontal alignment of the text.

Vertical Align `aligny` - ⊞ - Controls the vertical alignment of the text.

Vertical Align Mode `alignymode` - ⊞ - Controls how the alignment is calculated for vertical alignment.

* Use Font Metrics `metrics` - Uses the font defined layout information, ascender size, descender size etc. to layout the box. This provides consistent alignment regardless of the text contents.

* Use Text Bounding Box `bbox` - The alignment will be based on the bounding box of the current text string. This can cause the string to move up/down as the text changes. Useful to perfectly align static text that would otherwise be offset due to the character size and standard layout not resulting in the text being perfectly centered.

Padding `textpadding` - ⊞ - Extra padding to add to the sides of the layout box, pushing the text inwards for alignment.

* Padding `textpaddingl` - Padding on the left.

Geometry COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Geometry COMP

The Geometry Component is a 3D surface or [3D Object](Object.html "Object") that you render in TouchDesigner with a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). [Lights](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP"), [Cameras](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and other Components affect the scene, but are not visible surfaces.

Each Geometry Component contains a [Network](Network.html "Network") containing [SOPs](SOP.html "SOP") (and any other node types), where SOPs are the operators that define its 3D shape. The 3D surfaces can be [polygons](Polygon.html "Polygon"), [particles](Particle.html "Particle"), sprites, [meshes](Mesh.html "Mesh"), [NURBS](Spline.html "Spline") (with trim curves), [Bezier](Spline.html "Spline") patches or [metaballs](Metaball.html "Metaball"). They can be shaded as solid-shaded surfaces or as wireframes.

In the Geometry COMP's network

* the [SOPs](SOP.html "SOP") (Surface Operators) whose [Render Flag](Render_Flag.html "Render Flag") is On are rendered by a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). More than one SOP can be turned on for rendering in a Geometry component.
* The SOPs whose [Display Flag](Display_Flag.html "Display Flag") is on are seen in the [Geometry Viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer") of the Geometry COMP and Camera COMPs in the same network.

NOTE: Most often users turn on/off the Render and Display flags together so they are always in the same state.

See [Geometry Viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer") to learn about how you can inspect the SOPs that are turned on for display.

Some SOPs, like the [Texture SOP](Texture_SOP.html "Texture SOP") determine how texture images wrap and fit on the surface.

Every Geometry component needs a [Material](MAT.html "MAT") (MAT) operator to apply to the surface. This is assigned in the Material parameter of the Geometry component, or with a [Material SOP](Material_SOP.html "Material SOP").

To get to the Geometry Component's network, use the roller wheel to zoom into it, or hit Enter or 'i' after selecting a Geometry Component.

See [Geometry Viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer"), [Render Flag](Render_Flag.html "Render Flag") and [Display Flag](Display_Flag.html "Display Flag").

The sub-[Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") of [Component](Component.html "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A Geometry Component is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

(1) A Geometry Component can instance and render its SOP geometry many times: once for each sample in a CHOP, row of a DAT table, pixel in a TOP, or point of a SOP, (2) An instance is an OP that doesn't actually have its own data, but rather just refers to an OP (or has an input) whose data it uses. This includes Null OPs, Switch OPs and in some cases Select OPs.

The 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the Geometry COMP.

Gesture CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Gesture CHOP

The Gesture CHOP records a short segment of the first input and loops this segment in time with options as specified in the Gesture Page. The second input defines the "listen" input. The third input is used to reset the gesture.

**Tip**: The `gestureCapture` component in the palette is much more powerful and flexible to capture and record channels, and has full UI.

In the Gesture CHOP, when the first channel of the listen input goes above zero, the Gesture CHOP begins recording the first input's channels. While listen is on, the input channels are output exactly as is. When the listen is turned off, the recorded segment of the channels is processed (trimmed and blended). While listen is off, the recorded segment is looped continuously.

The Gesture CHOP determines the number of beats that the listen was on for; this defines the period of the loop. If the beat frequency changes, the period will change with it.

If "Fit to Nearest Cycle" is Off, the beats are ignored and the gesture length is exactly the time it took to record - the recorded segment will be looped back with a period equal to the recorded length. When On, the captured gesture will be extended or trimmed to be a multiple of the beats per cycle.

## Parameters - Gesture Page

Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Controls the gesture playback.

* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the gesture position to the [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline").

* Sequential `sequential` - This mode continually plays the gesture regardless of the timeline position. Reset and Reset Condition parameters below are enabled to allow some control.

Fit to Nearest Cycle `fitmethod` - When on the captured gesture will be extended or trimmed to be a multiple of the Beats Per Cycle.
Beats per Cycle `numbeats` - Specifies the number of beats to cycle the recorded animation around. If the recorded animation is longer than a multiple of the Beats Per Cycle, it will loop at that multiplied length.
Step Output `step` - If on, the cycled animation will adjust up or down each iteration to avoid jumps when looping to the beginning. For example, it would turn a simple 0-1 ramp gesture into a continuously increasing line.
Step Reset `stepreset` - When On and you re-record a gesture, the step will be zeroed.
Blend Time `blend` - How much of the recorded segment to use as a blend region. The blend region is used to blend the beginning of the segment to the end so that a seemless loop is produced.
Blend Time Unit `blendunit` -
Interpolate Samples `interp` - If on, recorded samples are interpolated when scaling occurs, otherwise the nearest sample is selected.
Speed `speed` - Scales the rate of playback for the segment.
Speed Unit `speedunit` -
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input (the third input) triggers a reset of the channel(s).

Reset `reset` - Resets the gesture while On when in **Sequential** Play Mode.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Resets the gesture.

GLSL COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# GLSL COMP

The GLSL COMP uses shaders to render an image in a panel directly to the screen. It is useful for rendering pixel accurate UIs as the resolution will automatically adapt to the DPI scaling of the screen it is displayed on. Panel variables can be accessed in the shader for responding to user events,

For more information on writing a shader, see the [GLSL Category](Category_GLSL.html "Category:GLSL").

* 4.40 `glsl440` -

* 4.50 `glsl450` -

* 4.60 `glsl460` -

Preprocess Directives `predat` - Use this DAT to place preprocessor directives at the start of your shader, such as #extension. This is required since these need to be the first lines in the shader, and TouchDesigner will be adding code to the start of your shader to declare uniforms/functions which would appear before #extension directives located in the main shader.
Vertex Shader `vdat` - Path to the DAT that holds the vertex shader code.
Pixel Shader `pdat` - Path to the DAT that holds the pixel shader code.
Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames` - This will read all the declared (and used) uniforms in the compiled GLSL shader, and fill in the various name fields for the uniform parameters.

* Line Strip `linestrip` -

Num Output Vertices `numout` - The maximum number of vertices the Geometry Shader will output.
Two Sided Coloring `twocolor` - Enables support for two-sided coloring. When this is enabled the Vertex and/or Geometry shader can write to gl\_FrontColor, gl\_BackColor, gl\_FrontSecondaryColor and gl\_BackSecondaryColor and the correct color will be placed into gl\_Color and gl\_SecondaryColor in the Pixel shader depending on if the primitive's front face or back face is facing the camera. When this is disabled the values placed into gl\_FrontColor and gl\_FrontSecondaryColor are passed to gl\_Color and gl\_SecondaryColor regardless of which side of the primitive is facing the camera.

Attribute `attr` - A sequence of attributes that should be made accesible in the shader. In the past these would be manually declared inside the shader, but to add support for POP based workflows, they need to be setup via these parameters instead. You can access the shaders using `TDAttrib_<attribName>()`.

Sampler `sampler` - Sequence of samplers for use in the shader
Name `sampler0name` - This is the sampler name that the GLSL program will use to sample from this TOP. The samplers need to be declared at the same dimentions as the TOP (sampler2D for a 2D TOP, sampler3D for 3D TOP).
TOP `sampler0top` - ⊞ - This is the TOP that will be referenced by the above sampler name above it.

Vector `vec` - Sequence of vectors to be used as uniforms
Name `vec0name` - The name of the vector.
Value `vec0value` - ⊞ - The value to assign to the uniform. If the uniform is a float the first entry of the four is used, if the uniform is a vec2 the first two entries are used, etc.

## Parameters - Arrays Page

CHOP Uniforms allow you to send CHOP channel data into a GLSL shader as an array. Depending on the array type used, the number of values you can send into the shader may be limited. If you are using Uniform Arrays, you can use the Built-In variable $SYS\_GFX\_GLSL\_MAX\_UNIFORMS to get an idea of how many values you can pass to the shader. Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is $SYS\_GFX\_GLSL\_MAX\_UNIFORMS / 4. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum.
If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, $SYS\_GFX\_MAX\_TEXTURE\_BUFFER\_SIZE will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.

Name `array` - Sequence of arrays to be used as uniforms
Array `array` - Sequence of arrays to be used as uniforms

## Parameters - Matrices Page

Relative Xforms are matrices that will transform points and vectors from one space to another space.

Matrix `matrix` - Sequence of matrices to be used as uniforms
Name `matrix0name` - The name of the uniform. The uniform should be declared as a mat4.
Matrix `matrix0value` - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the [Matrix Parameters](Matrix_Parameters.html "Matrix Parameters") article.

Relative `rel` - A sequence of relative transforms. The transform is the relative transform one Object COMP to another.
Name `rel0name` - The name of the uniform. The uniform should be declared as a mat4.
Xform from `rel0from` - Transform from this COMPs world transform.
To `rel0to` - Transform to this COMPs world transform.

[Specialization Constants](Write_a_GLSL_Material.html#Specialization_Constants "Write a GLSL Material") can optionally have their values assigned here.

Constant `const` - Sequence of constant uniforms.
Name `const0name` - The constant name, as declared in the shader.
Value `const0value` - The value to give the constant.

Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames` - When this button is pressed the node will try to pre-fill all it's uniform parameter with uniforms that are declare in the shader. Note that the shader compiler will likely not expose uniforms that are unused.
Auto Dispatch Size `autodispatchsize` - Automatically set the dispatch size based on the compute shader's local size and the output texture resolution. Ensures at least one thread per pixel will execute.
Dispatch Size `dispatchsize` - ⊞ - The dispatch size to use when executing a compute shader.

* X `dispatchsizex` -

* Y `dispatchsizey` -

* Z `dispatchsizez` -

Output Access `outputaccess` - ⊞ - Controls how the output textures will be accessed. If the textures will be read from (such as using previous frame's values), then the access should be changed to Read-Write instead of Write Only.

* Write Only `writeonly` -

* Read Only `readonly` -

* Read-Write `readwrite` -

Output Type `type` - ⊞ - Specify what type of texture to create. When creating a 3D texture the TOP will render once for every slice of the output. Refer to  [3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_TOP#3D_Textures_and_2D_Texture_Arrays "Write a GLSL TOP") for more info.

* 2D Texture `texture2d` - Creates a 2D texture.

* 2D Texture Array `texture2darray` - Creates a [2D Texture Array](https://docs.derivative.ca/2D_Texture_Array "2D Texture Array"). Slices of the array can be access using a non-normalized integer index for the w coordinate.

* 3D Texture `texture3d` - Creates a [3D Texture](https://docs.derivative.ca/3D_Texture "3D Texture"). Slices of the array can be accessed using the w coordinate in the range 0-1. Value of the texture in between slices are interpolated.

Depth `depth` - ⊞ - Set the depth of the 3D texture from the **Input** or the **Custom Depth** parameter.

* Input `input` -

Custom Depth `customdepth` - Manually set the depth of the 3D texture, otherwise it will use the depth of the input.
Clear Outputs `clearoutputs` -
Clear Value `clearvalue` - ⊞ -

* Clear Value `clearvaluer` -

* Clear Value `clearvalueg` -

* Clear Value `clearvalueb` -

* Clear Value `clearvaluea` -

Input Mapping `inputmapping` - ⊞ - Determines how the node's input(s) are passed into the shader for use when creating a 3D Texture. By default all of the inputs are passed to each slice. When using the **N inputs per Slice** mode, the first N inputs are passed to the first slice, the next N inputs are passed the second slice, and so on. When it runs out of inputs it loops back to the first input. N is selected by the parameter **N Value**.

* All Inputs to Every Slice `all` -

* N Input(s) per Slice `ninputs` -

N Value `nval` - Determines how many inputs are passed to the shader per slice when using the **N inputs per Slice** mode for **Input Mapping**. If for example this is set to 2, then the first 2 inputs will be passed to the first slice, the next 2 inputs will be passed the second slice, and so on. It will loop back to the start of the inputs if it runs out before it reaches the last slice.
Input Extend Mode UV `inputextenduv` - ⊞ - Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the U and V texture coordinates (called S and T in the shader) are outside [0-1] range.

Input Extend Mode W `inputextendw` - ⊞ - Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the W texture coordinate (called W in the shader) are outside [0-1] range. Only useful for [3D Texture](https://docs.derivative.ca/3D_Texture "3D Texture").

# of Color Buffers `numcolorbufs` - Any shader you write can output to more than one RGBA buffer at a time. Turn up this value to have more color buffers allocated for you, and refer to [Write\_a\_GLSL\_TOP#Outputting\_to\_Multiple\_Color\_Buffers Write a GLSL TOP] for more information on using this feature.

These are passed as uniforms into your shader. Depending on how the uniform is declared only some of the values of the 4 available per parameter as passes to the shader. For example, if the uniform is declared as a vec2, then only the first 2 values are passed to the shader, the other 2 are ignored.

Vector `vec` - Sequence of vector uniforms
Name `vec0name` - The uniform name, as declared in the shader
Value `vec0value` - ⊞ - The value(s) to give the uniform.

CHOP Uniforms allow you to send CHOP channel data into a GLSL shader as an array. Depending on the array type used, the number of values you can send into the shader may be limited. If you are using Uniform Arrays, you can use the Built-In variable `int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS'))` to get an idea of how many values you can pass to the shader. Current GPUs are vec4 based for uniform arrays, so the maximum array size is `int(var('SYS_GFX_GLSL_MAX_UNIFORMS')) / 4`. Other uniforms will take away from this maximum. If you are using Texture Buffers the maximum array size is far bigger, `int(var('SYS_GFX_MAX_TEXTURE_BUFFER_SIZE'))` will tell you the max for this. The max for texture buffer is per texture buffer, and having multiple texture buffers does not take away from the max for each array.

Array `array` - Sequence of array uniforms
Name `array0name` - The name of the uniform. You can send up to 4 channels into the GLSL shader in a single uniform. The number of channels is determined by the float/vec2/vec3/vec4 menu to the right of the name. For a CHOP with a single channel declare your uniform as a float, for one with two channels declare your uniform as a vec2, etc. The data is interleaved in the uniform. I.e the .x component is the 1st channel, .y is the 2nd channel, etc.
Type `array0type` - ⊞ - The data type of the uniform in the shader.

CHOP `array0chop` - The channels from this CHOP will be sent to the GLSL shader.
Array Type `array0arraytype` - ⊞ - The type of the uniform.

* Uniform Array `uniformarray` - All GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Uniform Arrays.

* Texture Buffer `texturebuffer` - Newer GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Texture Buffers. Texture Buffers use texture memory and texture fetches to access the data, which allows them to store many more values.

Declare them:

```
uniform samplerBuffer <uniformname>;

And sample them like this

```
vec4 val = texelFetch(<uniformname>, i);

Where i is the 0-based index (an integer) into the buffer that you want to get a value for.

Matrix `matrix` - Sequence of matrix uniforms
Name `matrix0name` - The name of the matrix uniform.
Matrix `matrix0value` - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the [Matrix Parameters](Matrix_Parameters.html "Matrix Parameters") article.

## Parameters - Atomic Counters Page

Atomic Counter `ac` - Sequence of atomic counter uniforms
Name `ac0name` - The name of the uniform.
Initial Value Type `ac0initvalue` - ⊞ - Specifies how the atomic counters receive their initial value, either through a single default value or a CHOP.

* Single Value `val` -

* CHOP Values `chop` -

Initial Value `ac0singlevalue` - Specifies a single value that all atomic counters in this binding will be initialized to.
Initial Values CHOP `ac0chopvalue` - A reference to the CHOP that will determine the initial values of the atomic counters in this binding. The CHOP will be spanned in track order, so the values from the first track will be read in order first, then the next track (if there is one) and so on. If there are more initial values to fill than there are values in the CHOP then they will all be set to 0. Atomic counters will be initialized from low to high offsets.

* Input 0:  - Multi input

# GLSL TOP

The GLSL TOP renders a GLSL [shader](Shader.html "Shader") into a TOP image. Use the Info DAT to check for compile errors in your shaders.

The GLSL TOP can act as a pixel shader, or the more general and complex [Compute Shader](Compute_Shader.html "Compute Shader"). Caveat: Compute Shaders need GLSL 4.30 or later.

The GLSL TOP has one docked compute shader as well as a normal GLSL shader. Change he Mode to Compute Shader. it will use the `glsl1_compute` DAT.
  
  
**Refer to the [Write a GLSL TOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Write_a_GLSL_TOP "Write a GLSL TOP") article for more info on using this TOP.**

See the [GLSL Category](Category_GLSL.html "Category:GLSL") for more information, and [Compute Shader](Compute_Shader.html "Compute Shader").

Preprocess Directives `predat` - Use this DAT to place preprocessor directives at the start of your shader, such as #extension. This is required since these need to be the first lines in the shader, and TouchDesigner will be adding code to the start of your shader to declare uniforms/functions which would appear before #extension directives located in the main shader. #include statements should be avoided unless include-guards are in the DATs. This should **not** be used for pre-prending common code to your shaders. Use #include statements in the main shader to do that.

Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames` - When this button is pressed the node will try to pre-fill all it's uniform parameter with uniforms that are declare in the shader. Note that the shader compiler will likely not expose uniforms that are unused.
Auto Dispatch Size `autodispatchsize` - Automatically set the dispatch size based on the compute shader's local size and the output texture resolution. Ensures at least one thread per pixel will execute.
Dispatch Size `dispatchsize` - ⊞ - The dispatch size to use when executing a compute shader.

Custom Depth `customdepth` - Manually set the depth of the 3D texture, otherwise it will use the depth of the input.
Clear Outputs `clearoutputs` - When using a Compute Shader, this controls if the output texture should be cleared at the start of each cook. Otherwise the data from the previous cook will stay in the texture, and pixels can be left as-is in the Compute Shader.
Clear Value `clearvalue` - ⊞ - The color value to clear all pixels to at the start of the cook.

Group Class - Derivative

# Group Class

An Group describes groups lists of [Prim Class](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") or [Point Class](Point_Class.html "Point Class").

A Group can be created with the [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP") or using the `createPointGroup(str)` or `createPrimGroup(str)` methods of the [ScriptSOP Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ScriptSOP_Class "ScriptSOP Class").

`default` → `tuple` **(Read Only)**:

> The default values associated with this Group. It returns a tuple item of group points.

> Set/gets the group name.

> Gets the owner of this group.

`add(item : [Point](Point_Class.html "Point Class") | [Prim](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") | int)`→ `None`:

> Adds a point/primitive to this group. The point or primitive to be added can be specified by a point, primitive object or the index of a point or primitive object.

`discard(item : [Point](Point_Class.html "Point Class") | [Prim](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") | int)`→ `None`:

> Removes a point/primitive from this group. The point or primitive to be removed can be specified by a point, primitive object or the index of a point or primitive object.

> Destroys the current point/primitive group.

# Group SOP

The Group SOP generates groups of points or primitives according to various criteria and allows you to act upon these groups. Elements can occur in more than one group. Groups are used in many parts of the SOP Editor to specify which portion(s) of input geometry you wish a SOP to act upon.

You can also create ordered groups. To do so, check the Ordered button.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[groupSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/GroupSOP_Class "GroupSOP Class")

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Group Page](#Parameters_-_Group_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Create Page](#Parameters_-_Create_Page)
* [4 Parameters - Combine Page](#Parameters_-_Combine_Page)
* [5 Parameters - Edit Page](#Parameters_-_Edit_Page)
* [6 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group Name `crname` - The name of the group to be created. The default name is set to match the name of the SOP.
Entity `entity` - ⊞ - Primitives or Points.

## Parameters - Create Page

Use Number `usenumber` - Allows selection of grouping of entities by number. When the Enable button is Active, the selection options become active and can be used to select entities. The fields available are listed below.
Create Ordered `ordered` - When selected, elements in the group are traversed in the order they are selected; otherwise they are traversed in creation order.
Operation `groupop` - ⊞ - When the Number Enable button is checked, this option groups entities based on a defined Pattern or by a Range.

* Group by Pattern `grppattern` - Select a pattern in the Pattern field below.

* Group by Range `grprange` - Select a Range using the Start/End and Select\_of\_ fields below.

* Group by Expression `grpexpression` - Select a range using the Filter Expression field below.

For Example:

* `0.4 2 4 2.5 3.7` selects three profiles and two primitives,
* `0-100:2` selects every other number from 0 to 100,
* `0-10:2,3` selects every two of three,
* `0.0-6` selects six profiles on primitive 0,
* `0.*` selects all profiles on primitive 0,
* `!4` selects every primitive or point except the fourth,
* `9-0` selects first ten (in reverse if ordered flag is on),
* `!0.*` selects all profiles except those on primitive 0,
* `*` selects all primitives or points, and no profiles.

See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") for details.

Transfer Selection to Pattern `transfer` - This allows you to define the range of points / primitives visually by selecting them in the Viewport with the Select state. Clicking this button transfers the selected points/primitives into the Pattern field as a compacted range (e.g. `1-23 40 67-100`). This eliminates the need for typing the point or primitive numbers manually.

**Note:** Point and primitive selections can be dumped directly into Group fields without use of the Group SOP. Do this by selecting the points or primitives in the Viewport with the Select state. Then the pop-up N menu beside the Group field of the SOP you want to cook should display the selection in the input SOP (e.g. "grid1's Primitive Selection"). Ranges are automatically compacted.

**For Example:** entering 1 and 2 selects 1 out of every 2 entities.

Filter Expression `filter` - The Filter Expression provided is evaluated for every point/primitive. Wherever it is true, the entity is added. All the local variables of point and primitive are present, though only accessable when the right type of group is being created.

Use Bounds `usebounds` - This option is used for selecting entities based on bounding volumes: Bounding Box, or Bounding Sphere. When Active, the selection options become active and can be used to select entities. The fields available are listed below. The bounding volume can be seen in the viewport as guide geometry.
Bounding Type `boundtype` - ⊞ - Selects the type of bounding volume to use

* Bounding Box `usebbox` - Entities contained within the box are selected.

* Bounding Sphere `usebsphere` - Entities contained within the sphere are selected.

* Bounding Object (points only) `usebobject` - Points contained within the Object are selected. Make sure the object consists of well formed polygons. If using an irregular mesh, convert to polygons with a Convert SOP, then use a Divide SOP to convex sides to 3.

Use Normal `usenormal` - This option is used for selecting entities based on the angle of the entity normals. When the Active, the selection options become active and can be used to select entities. The fields available are listed below.

Spread Angle `angle` - The value entered in this field generates an angle of deviation from the primary axis. This can be visualized as a cone where the radius of the base of the cone is defined by the Spread Angle and the axis of the cone is determined by the Direction axis. Viewing the primitive normals in the viewport, you can see that any primitives with normals that have an angle that lies in the range of angles defined by the cone will be selected and grouped.
Backface from `camera` - This menu allows you to select an object. Typically, a camera object would be chosen. The primitives which are backface when viewed from the object specified will be grouped or selected.
Use Edges `useedges` - Allows you to group primitives by edges.
Edge Angle `doangle` - Enables the Edge Angle parameter.
Edge Angle `edgeangle` - Specifies an angle between edges in which to group. Works only for primitive groups.
Edge Depth `dodepth` - Enables the Edge Depth parameter.
Edge Depth `edgestep` - Enter the depth of the edge (only for point groups).
Point Number `point` - Enter the specific point numbers (only for point groups).
Unshared Edges `unshared` - When selecting points, this option selects the points of a ploygonal mesh which appear on the boundary (i.e. those which are not shared) for inclusion in the group, and orders them. In addition to polygonal meshes, this option also finds the boundaries of geo Hulls and open faces.
Create Boundary Groups `boundarygroups` - When selecting points with the Unshared Edges parameter, this option becomes available. Enabling it creates new groups of the form: <name>\_\_< n> , (two underscores) where the < name> is the Group Name specified in the Create page. Numbers < n> begin at zero, and increment as more groups are created.

These groups contain the points on each boundary of the surface. For example, if you have a grid with a hole in the middle of it, two new point groups are created - one containing the points for the outer boundary and one with the points from the hole. These new point groups are also ordered.

## Parameters - Combine Page

This page of parameters lets you modify the The number of primitives or points in one of the input groups by combining groups through different operations.

# Handle CHOP

The Handle CHOP is the "engine" which drives Inverse Kinematic solutions using the [Handle COMP](Handle_COMP.html "Handle COMP"). The role of the Handle CHOP is to generate rotation values for the bones which will bring their attached handles as close to their respective targets as possible.

The use of this method is best described with an example:

1. Increase the frame range to 10000. Create a [Null COMP](Null_COMP.html "Null COMP") called 'target' and animate a few random positions for it to travel to.
2. Create a three bone IK chain with No Kinematics. Append a [Handle COMP](Handle_COMP.html "Handle COMP") to the last bone.
3. In the Handle COMP set the Target menu to Target. This is the Null COMP you just created.
4. The system is now specified. To actually start the IK enter a CHOP pane.
5. Place a Handle CHOP. In the Source field type in the names of the bones that were earlier created.
6. Click the Export button on the Handle CHOP and click Play. You should now see the two-bone system chasing the animated null.

**Tip:** In the [geometry viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer"), you can use the **Select** state to select the bones you created. Then in the Handle CHOP click the **Grab Source Form Selection** button. The names are entered automatically for you. You don't have to worry about being too picky when selecting objects this way, since non-bone objects are ignored.

You can place any number of bones with any number of (possibly zero) Handles attached to the system. The following parameter description will now give a more detailed explanation of the functionality:

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[handleCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/HandleCHOP_Class "HandleCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Handle Page

Source `source` - Creates `rx`/`ry`/`rz` channels for each bone listed.
Fixed `fixed` - If you have entered bones which form a branch or should act as a unit, enter them here. An example may be two bones splitting at the shoulders. You want them to rotate, but only as a unit.
Iterations `iterations` - Increasing this parameters gives a more accurate solution at the cost of cooking time. Preroll (only when precalculating a range of frames, SingleFrame turned off): This will cook the solution a given number of frames before the requested frame range. Max Angle Change: This will limit the delta angle degrees the bones can move in any given frame. Use this to tame erratic behavior.
Init Frame `init` - Specifies a frame in which the bones are reset to their default rest angles.
Preroll `preroll` - Specifies the number of iterations to solve at the initialization frame.
Max Angle Change `delta` - Specifies the maximum change in degrees the solver is allowed to move each bone per frame. Use this parameter if the solution is too drastic.

# Handle COMP

The Handle Component is a new IK tool designed for manipulating groups of bones. Whereas the previous IK tools only allowed for a single end-affector per bone chain, this new method allows for several end-affectors per bone. Furthermore, the bones need not be a chain. Any setup, including branches, are handled.

One typical example is the use of motion capture data. In higher-end systems, you could have a cloud of marker positions and a skeleton to be driven by it.

This Handle Component works in tandem with the [Handle CHOP](Handle_CHOP.html "Handle CHOP"). The following setup is commonly used: Given a hierarchy of bones, attach one or more Handle Components to specific locations on each Bone Component. Assign each handle a target in space to follow. Create a Handle CHOP which collects this information and calculates the rotation channels for the bones. Export these values back to the bones.

Helios DAC CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Helios DAC CHOP

Helios DAC is a laser controller. The Helios DAC CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to a [Helios DAC](http://pages.bitlasers.com/helios/). The Helios DAC device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the Helios DAC CHOP. Applications of the Helios DAC CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.

**Note:** The Helios DAC CHOP listens for any device changes on the system and will perform a Helios device re-scan when triggered. However, the re-scan can only be triggered if all Helios connections are closed, meaning all Helios DAC CHOPs are either deactivated or bypassed. To perform a Helios device re-scan with only a single Helios DAC CHOP, simply deactivate and reactivate the CHOP.

# Hokuyo CHOP

The Hokuyo CHOP is used for communication with Hokuyo laser scanners (serial or ethernet interface): [Hokuyo Products](http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/search/)

The Hokuyo CHOP will work with all serial or ethernet Hokuyo laser scanners, though the only laser scanners tested in-house are the URG-04LX-UG01 (Serial) and the UST-10LX (Ethernet).

It can be used with the [Blob Track CHOP](Blob_Track_CHOP.html "Blob Track CHOP") to detect objects in its field. See the Snippet for Blob Track.

All of a computer's available serial ports can be found in the Device Manager under the Windows operating system. Their names begin with 'COM'. Example: COM1, COM2, COM3, etc.

The Hokuyo CHOP outputs the measurement data from the laser scan in meters, either in Polar or Cartesian Coordinates. The laser scan is done counter clockwise over N degrees (defined by the device, eg. URG-04LX-UG01 is 240 degrees, UST-10LX is 270 degrees) and returns the distance to the first object hit by the laser at that point.

The Hokuyo laser scanners have an angular resolution that specifies the number of data points returned from a full scan. For the URG-04LX-UG01 there is a data point every ~0.3515 degrees, so over a 240 degree scan there is a total of 682 data points. For the UST-10LX there is a data point every 0.25 degrees, so over a 270 degree scan there is a total of 1080 data points. The Hokuyo laser scanners also have a start and end step that define a total detection range.

The UST-10LX has the same measurement parameters as the UTM-30LX in the chart below. The UST-20LX ethernet model will also work like the UST-10LX.

For a visualization of the scan and a table of device specific numbers, see the image below:

[![Scan info.jpg](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/0/08/Scan_info.jpg)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Scan_info.jpg)

If the Hokuyo device is an ethernet model like the UTM-30LX-EW, make sure Window Firewall is not blocking it. Each install of TD will need to be allowed through the firewall separately. This commonly catches people out with networking OPs, as sometimes the Windows “allow TD to network” dialog doesn’t open on first connection attempt. A quick disabling of the firewall will let you test this theory.

Hold CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Hold CHOP

The Hold CHOP waits for a 0 to 1 step on its second input, at which time it reads the current values from the first input (one value per channel). It holds the values constant until it receives another 0 to 1 step. The second input controls the sampling. When the second input changes from 0 to 1, the first input is sampled. This value is held in the output until the second input changes from 0 to 1 again. Hold does not sample while the second input is 1, nor on the falling edge (1 to 0).

A common application for this CHOP is to grab the current value of a channel when an event occurs, so that value can be used until the event occurs again.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[holdCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/HoldCHOP_Class "HoldCHOP Class")

Sample `sample` - ⊞ - Defines when to sample the input channels. The parameters are as follows.

* Off to On `offtoon` - Sample incoming channel when the trigger channel goes from 0 to above 0.

* While On `whileon` - Sample incoming channel while the trigger channel is above 0.

* On to Off `ontooff` - Sample incoming channel when the trigger channel goes above 0 to 0.

* While Off `whileoff` - Sample incoming channel while the trigger channel is 0.

* On Value Change `valuechange` - Sample incoming channel whenever the trigger channel changes.

Hold Last `hold` - When On continue to sample the input, when Off hold the values.
Hold Last Pulse `holdpulse` - Sample the input and hold those values when pulsed.
Hold per Sample `holdsamples` - Useful for working with multi-sample channels, this applies the hold to each sample of the channel instead of only the last sample in the channel.

Hole SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Hole SOP

The Hole SOP is for making holes where faces are enclosed, even if they are not in the same plane. It can also remove existing holes from the input geometry.

The holes are made by searching for faces which are enclosed by other faces and creating bridges to the interior faces. It offers more flexibility than either the [Extrude SOP](Extrude_SOP.html "Extrude SOP") or [Divide SOP](Divide_SOP.html "Divide SOP")'s hole-making capabilities because it can deal with interior faces which are not exactly in the same orientation as the exterior ones. It can also remove existing bridges that it finds in the input geometry if needed.

**Note:** This SOP works with Polygonal and Bezier geometry types only. NURBS surfaces will be converted internally to Beziers.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[holeSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/HoleSOP_Class "HoleSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Unbridge Holes `unbridge` - This function checks for bridges to holes in the input and removes the bridges, leaving the interior freestanding. At times you may need to unhole faces so that you can connect them in some other way.
Distance Tolerance `dist` - Interior polygons that are not in exactly the same plane as the exteriors can still become holes. The Distance Tolerance value tells the Hole SOP how far away potential holes can be from the exterior surfaces. Faces beyond this distance will not become holes.
Angle Tolerance `angle` - Interior faces that are rotated in relation to the exterior faces can become holes. The Angle value sets the maximum rotation of the potential holes from the exteriors. Faces beyond this rotation will not become holes.
Snap Holes to Outlines `snap` - Points of any holes that are rotated or translated away from the exterior (or outline) plane will be moved so that they lie on the surface of the outline plane, thus avoiding twisted faces.

Extra Information for the Hole SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

HSV Adjust TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# HSV Adjust TOP

The HSV Adjust TOP adjust color values using hue, saturation, and value controls. If you change the Hue Offset, Saturation Multiplier and Value Multiplier without changing any of the other parameters then you will modify the color of all pixels in the image. The other parameters are used to narrow the range of pixels you want to modify based on their hue, saturation and value. For example if you leave the Hue Range untouched but reduce the saturation range, you will cause the TOP to modify only pixels who fall into the new saturation range. The range is the Start Color's saturation + the Range + the Falloff, in this example.

## Parameters - HSV Tweak Page

[![HSVadjust.jpg](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/4/4a/HSVadjust.jpg)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:HSVadjust.jpg)

Start Color `startcolor` - ⊞ - The start color is the hue that the HSV adjustment is centered around. When adjusting a small hue range, this is the color that will be altered. In the example image above, the Start Color color is cyan with a hue value of 180.

* Red `startcolorr` -

* Green `startcolorg` -

* Blue `startcolorb` -

Hue Range `huerange` - This is the range of color from the Start Color that will be adjusted. A range of 1 will only adjust the colors that are the same as the start color. A range of 360 will adjust all colors. For example, a range of 20 and a Start Color of 180 will adjust colors in the hue range of 170-190.
Hue Falloff `huefalloff` - This controls the falloff from the Hue Range. Higher values give more falloff, blending the hue range softly from hues that are adjusted to hues that are not.
Saturation Range `saturationrange` - This is the range of saturation to adjust from the saturation of the Start Color. The Range is from 0 to 1.
Saturation Falloff `saturationfalloff` - This controls the falloff from the Saturation Range selected.
Value Range `valuerange` - This is the range of value to adjust from the value of the Start Color. The Range is from 0 to 1.
Value Falloff `valuefalloff` - This controls the falloff from the Value Range selected.
Hue Offset `hueoffset` - Adjust the hues selected above. The Hue Offset ranges from 0 to 360. For example, if the initial pixel color is 180 then a Hue Offset of 100 will change the hue of 180 (cyan) to be a hue of 280 (violet).
Saturation Multiplier `saturationmult` - Adjusts the saturations selected above. This will multiply the saturation values specified by Saturation Range and Falloff parameters above. Setting this to 0 will reduce the selected saturation to 0, setting it to 1 will maintain the current saturation values, and setting it to 2 will make the selected saturation twice as saturated.
Value Multiplier `valuemult` - Adjusts the values selected above. This will multiply the values specified by Value Range and Falloff parameters above.

Import Select SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Import Select SOP

The Import Select SOP is used to import and load the geometry types primitives defined in [USD COMP](USD_COMP.html "USD COMP") and [FBX COMP](FBX_COMP.html "FBX COMP"). It essentially loads any geometry type that [USD COMP](USD_COMP.html "USD COMP") or [FBX COMP](FBX_COMP.html "FBX COMP") can support such as a Mesh, Points, NURBS Curves or Patches, Basis Curves. Each geometry represents one primitive from the loading file or it can be a set of primitives merged together for better performance.

In [USD COMP](USD_COMP.html "USD COMP") and [FBX COMP](FBX_COMP.html "FBX COMP") if the Import Select SOP renders merged geometries, an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") operator is created next to this SOP which represents the original paths of primitives within/from importing file, which can be useful for user to checkout what geometry the current SOP is made of.
Import Select SOP can have its own animation controls within the Playback page or use the settings from its parent COMP.

The imported geometry can be loaded directly from GPU or CPU, depending on whether the Straight To GPU toggle is set to ON or not at the parent COMP node.

Impulse Force COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Impulse Force COMP

An Impulse Force COMP will create a force in the simulation that can be applied for 1 frame using the Pulse Force parameter. In the real world, impulse forces are forces applied over a very short duration, however in [Bullet](Bullet_Dynamics.html "Bullet Dynamics") this is somewhat simplified, and they are instead applied instantly (for a single frame). Examples of impulse forces are kicking a ball or shooting a cannon. The velocities of the affected bodies are changed in an instant by the impulse force, and after that instant the force no longer has an effect unless applied again.

The resulting velocity of the bodies after the impulse force is applied is the same as the [Force COMP](Force_COMP.html "Force COMP") with the same values if the Force COMP is applied for exactly 1 second. For example, if 10N of Impulse Force is applied to a body with mass 5kg then the resulting velocity will be 10N / 5kg \* 1sec = 2m/s.

* [3 Parameters - Extensions Page](#Parameters_-_Extensions_Page)
* [4 Parameters - Common Page](#Parameters_-_Common_Page)

Pulse Force `pulse` - Pulse for the impulse force. When pulsed, on the next frame it will apply the impulse force.
Force `force` - ⊞ - The linear force in Newtons to be applied when the node is pulsed.

Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See [Parent Shortcut](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut").
Global Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut").
Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").
OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").
Node View `nodeview` - ⊞ - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer"). Some options will not be available depending on the Component type ([Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component"), [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component"), Misc.)

Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
Keep in Memory `keepmemory` - Used only for [Panel Components](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") this keeps the panel in memory to it doesn't reload every time it is displayed.
Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](Clone.html "Clone").
Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
External .tox `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
Reload .tox on Start `reloadtoxonstart` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
Re-Init Network `reinitnet` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present), followed by re-initializing itself from its master, if it's a clone.

In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# In CHOP

The In CHOP gets channels that are connected to one of the inputs of the component. For each In CHOP inside a component, there is one input connector added to the In CHOP's parent component.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[inCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/InCHOP_Class "InCHOP Class")

## Parameters - In Page

Label `label` - The label for this input on the COMP that will show up in a popup if the mouse is held over it.
Num Channels `numchannels` - If On, and the number of incoming channels does not match this value, an error is generated.
Names `channames` - When used with Num Channels the input is scanned for channels matching these names. All other channels are ignored and not passed through. This is a way of filtering out unnecessary channels without requiring a [Select CHOP](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP") or [Delete CHOP](Delete_CHOP.html "Delete CHOP"). When used without Num Channels the input channels are simply renamed according to this pattern.

Info CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Info CHOP

The Info CHOP gives you extra information about a node. All nodes contain extra inside information, and different types of nodes (TOPs, CHOPs, etc) contain different subsets of information. This additional information can be accessed via an Info CHOP.

The Info CHOP's extra attributes for specific OPs are also expressed as python members of those operators. The the operators python class for more information.

Any OP that has a `.timecode` member will also have a Timecode Info Type available to view the timecode value as a set of CHOP channels. See [OPs with a timecode member](Timecode.html#Operators_with_a_.timecode_Member "Timecode") and the [Timecode](Timecode.html "Timecode") page for more info.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[infoCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/InfoCHOP_Class "InfoCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Info Page

Operator `op` - The path of the node that the Info CHOP is getting information from. You can drag and drop any node onto this path, or type the path directly into the field.
Info Type `infotype` - ⊞ - Select the channel set associated with the Info Type.

* All `all` - Selects all channel sets and appends them to the output.

* General `general` - Selects the channels of the specific OP type and the OP family as a whole.

* Timecode `timecode` - (Optional) **Note:** Timecode entry will only appear in the list if the Operator referenced has a `.timecode` member. Provides the .timecode value as a set of CHOP channels: `hour`, `minute`, `second`, `frame`.

Scope `iscope` - The names of the attributes to keep. Name patterns may be used as detailed in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Values `values` - ⊞ - Select channel with values inside or outside the range specified in Range.

* All `all` - All channels selected.

* Inside Range `inside` - Channels with values inside Range selected.

* Outside Range `outside` - Channels with values outside Range selected.

Range `range` - ⊞ - Set the bounds for selecting channels by value.

* `range1` -

* `range2` -

Passive `passive` - When Passive is Off the Info CHOP will cook the Operator it is pointing to before querying its values. When Passive is On it will not force a cook. A side effect: If the Info CHOP and the target are both cooking that frame, the Info may cook before the target, so it’s data will be a frame late.
Children Cook Time `childcooktime` - When the Info CHOP is monitoring a [Component](Component.html "Component"), this toggle will enable a channel called `children_cpu_cook_time` which is the total cooktime of all the component's children. This is off by default, enabling it for a large network may impact performance as all cooktimes need to be summed.

# Interpolate CHOP

The Interpolate CHOP treats its multiple-inputs as keyframes and interpolates between them. The inputs are usually single-frame CHOP channels like those produced by a [Constant CHOP](Constant_CHOP.html "Constant CHOP"). The Interpolate CHOP first sorts the input CHOPs in time (without shifting them) and interpolates between them to fill the gaps.

The number of channels in the output is the same as the number of channels in the first input.

If a channel is missing in an input, and Match By is set to Channel Name, it is treated as if there is no keyframe at that frame for that channel, and the interpolation occurs between CHOPs before and after that frame.

Inverse Curve CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Inverse Curve CHOP

The Inverse Curve CHOP calculates an inverse kinematics simulation for [bone objects](Bone_COMP.html "Bone COMP") using a curve object.

The Inverse Curve CHOP will stretch and position a set of bones to follow a curve defined by another set of [objects](Object.html "Object") (guide).

Specify the first and last bone in the chain with Bone Start / Bone End.

Specify the Guide by listing them in order, space separated, in the Guide Components field. This parameter also accepts patterns and wildcards. Example: `null[1-5] null17 null4`. You can also specify bones in this group as well.

The CHOP will then create a set of rotate and bone-length channels for each bone. Additionally, the CHOP will also output 3 translate channels for the first bone in the chain. It will also setup the export links automatically, so you just have to turn on the export flag for this CHOP.

The way the CHOP solves this system is by creating a guide curve between the supplied Guide objects. Use the Interpolation and Order parameters to define what type of curve it will use. By default, the control vertices of the curve will be the centroids of the object. The curve is also given orientation, by adopting the orientation of each guide object. The bones line up their X axes with this orientation.

You can view this curve by using the [Inverse Curve SOP](Inverse_Curve_SOP.html "Inverse Curve SOP"). Just supply it with the name of the Inverse Curve CHOP and it will extract the geometry for viewing/debugging purposes. It actually will contain 3 curves (the original guide, and the guide displaced in +X and +Y). These curves can be skinned with a [Skin SOP](Skin_SOP.html "Skin SOP") for better feedback, etc.

The span parameters can be used to trim out the beginning and end of the guide curve if so needed. For example Span 0.3 0.7 will lay the bones along the middle 40% of the curve.

In the rare case that the user has setup a curve with all the X axes (twists) pointing along the same direction of the curve, then the Up Vector parameter is used to break the tie, so to speak. However, this curve setup is likely degenerate to start with and should be avoided by twisting all the objects 90 degrees.

  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Kinematics Page

Solver Type `solvertype` - ⊞ - This parameter defines the method used to determine the motion of the Bone object when it, its ancestor, or its children are moved.

* None `none` - No motion solution is applied to the Bone object.

* Show Rest Position `rest` - This solver is used to show the rest position of the bones. It orients the bones at the rest position defined by the rest angles in the chain. These rest angles are used in the Inverse Kinematics solver. Therefore, this solver can be used as a helper utility to show you the rest positions of the chain.

* Show Capture Position `capture` - This solver is used to display the rotation values in the capture angles parameter. These parameters are set in the Skeleton sop when a "capture points" operation is performed, or by using the Grab Capture Angles menu. Like the Show Rest Position solver, this solver can be used to return a chain to its capture orientation.

* Inverse Kinematics `inverse` - The IK solver tries to position the bones such that the end of the last bone in the chain touches the origin of the object defined as the end affector. The shape of the chain is derived from the rest angles of each the bones in the chain.

In order to adjust the results of the IK solver, you can adjust the rest angles of the bones. Note that the IK solver's solutions are guaranteed to be continuous only for a given set of rest angles. If you animate the rest angles you may end up with chains that jump around.
When using kinematics, the rotations given by the kinematic solver can be exported to the bones using by enabling the export flag on the Inverse Kin CHOP. Adding rotation values to bone objects in a kinematic chain is not recommended, as those values will be over-written by the kinematic solver.

* IK with Constraints `constraint` -

* Follow Curve `curve` - This solver positions the bones to be aligned along the first curve in an object. It is useful for animating things such as tails and spines.

Root Bone `boneroot` - The starting bone of the chain; where the chain starts.
End Bone `boneend` - If you specify a bone as the last bone in chain, then you will be defining a bone chain that has the current bone as the first in the chain and the bone chosen from the menu as the final bone in the chain. This chain includes all bones in between those just chosen.
End Affector `endaffector` - This specifies which object will serve as the chain's end affector.
Twist Affector `twistaffector` - If you specify a twist affector, the entire bone chain will twist along the axis from the chain's root to its end-affector so that the first bone is pointing as much as it can at the twist affector. The twist value can be specified as well, and is applied on top of the twist generated for the twist affector.
IK Twist `iktwist` - Amount of twist allowed by the kinematics solution.
IK Dampening `ikdampen` - Amount of damping (slows down at the extremes of angular allowability).
Curve Object `curve` - Curve object to follow.

Iso Surface SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Iso Surface SOP

The Iso Surface SOP uses implicit functions to create 3D visualizations of isometric surfaces found in Grade 12 Functions and Relations textbooks.

An implicit function is defined so that it = 0. For example with:

```
x2 + y2 = r2

the implicit function is:

```
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 - r2 = 0

* [4 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [4.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Implicit Function `func` - Enter the function for implicit surface building here.

Example 1: `(me.curPos.x**2) / (4*4) - (me.curPos.y**2) / (3*3) + me.curPos.z`

This formula creates a hyperbolic paraboloid, or saddle shape.

Example 2: `(me.curPos.x**2) / 0.1 + (me.curPos.y**2) / 2 + (me.curPos.z**2) / 6 - 1`

This formula creates an ellipsoid.

Minimum Bound `min` - ⊞ - Determines the minimum clipping plane boundary for display of iso surface.

* X `minx` -

* Y `miny` -

* Z `minz` -

Maximum Bound `max` - ⊞ - Determines maximum clipping plane boundary for display of iso surfaces.

* X `maxx` -

* Y `maxy` -

* Z `maxz` -

Divisions `divs` - ⊞ - The density, or resolution of the iso surface polygons in X, Y and Z.

Compute Normals `normals` - Adds normals to the surface.

The action of the Iso Surface sop is conceptually simple - it takes a user specified expression in R3 (a mathematical term meaning, "having three dimensions, each taking a Real value), and creates a surface where the function goes from being positive to being negative. In the case of the default expression ( `me.curPos[0] * me.curPos[0] + me.curPos[1] * me.curPos[1] + me.curPos[2] * me.curPos[2] - 1` ), the expression is less than zero within a unit sphere, and greater than zero outside. As the sop cooks, it marches through the bounding volume specified (by default from -1 to +1 in X, Y and Z), and creates geometry where the expression equals zero.

This may seem like a difficult way to define a sphere, but there's much potential beyond this simple example using the rich array of mathematical functions (see the Expressions section). A simple illustration is with the `noise()` function. Try inputing the following expression.

# Join CHOP

The Join CHOP takes all its inputs and appends one CHOP after another. It is expected they all have the same channels.

The end section of the first CHOP is overlapped with the start section of the second CHOP, and so on for the rest of the input CHOPs. The second input is shifted to line up with the end of the first.

Blending allows you to splice channels together by slowly phasing out one CHOP while phasing into the next, or by inserting interpolation curves between the channels of the adjacent CHOPs.

Quaternion Blend blends rotation triplets (rx ry rz) together using the shortest rotation arc. Rotation triplets are identified by "quaternion" attributes, which are set in the [Attribute CHOP](Attribute_CHOP.html "Attribute CHOP").

Translation Blending blends translation channels together by slowly changing from the final velocity of the previous channel to the initial velocity of the next. The next channel may be shifted up or down. If this is undesirable, use cubic blending instead (in the Shape menu). Translation Blending is done on channel triplets that represent translations or positions (\*tx \*ty \*tz).

# Join SOP

The Join SOP connects a sequence of faces or surfaces into a single primitive that inherits their attributes. Faces of different types can be joined together, and so can surfaces. Mixed face-surface types are not allowed. The surfaces do not have to have the same number of rows or columns in the side being joined. Spline types of different orders and parameterization are all valid inputs. The Join SOP converts simpler primitives such as polygons into Bziers and NURBS if necessary.

Joining is different from filleting (see [Fillet SOP](Fillet_SOP.html "Fillet SOP")) or stitching (see [Stitch SOP](Stitch_SOP.html "Stitch SOP")) because it takes n primitives and converts them into one after possibly changing the connected ends of the primitives. Filleting creates a new primitive between each input pair and never affects the original shapes. Stitching changes the original shapes but does not change the number of resulting primitives.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[joinSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/JoinSOP_Class "JoinSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Blend `blend` - Determines the way the primitives are joined. A blended face or surface will typically reposition the ends to be joined and convert them into a single, common point, row or column respectively. The amount of change can be reduced or eliminated by lowering the tolerance (see Tolerance below). When not blended, the original shapes remain unaffected. Instead, the chosen ends are joined by an arc-like fillet. In either case, the result is a single primitive.
Tolerance `tolerance` - The meaning of the tolerance varies with the type of join. The shapes of blended primitives will change less if the tolerance is low. If the tolerance is < `1`, a new point, knot, row or column is inserted between the last and before-last point, row or column. The lower the tolerance, the closer the insertion to the ends being pulled together, and thus the smaller the region affected. When the tolerance is zero the blended inputs do not change at all: the faces are connected by a straight line and the surfaces by a flatish, linear patch.

Tolerance also affects the size and roundness of the fillet built between non-blended primitives. A zero tolerance yields a short, flat fillet; a unit tolerance generates pointed, non self-intersected fillet.

Bias `bias` - Affects only blended primitives by varying the position of the common point, row or column linearly between the two original ends. If the bias is zero, the common part will coincide with the end of the second primitive and the end of the first primitive will be stretched all the way to it. If the bias is one, the common part will coincide with the end of the first primitive and the second primitive will be stretched.

The bias is irrelevant when the blend tolerance is 0.

Multiplicity `knotmult` - Affects the number of knots inserted at the blend point and thus allows for smooth or pointed connections. The connection will be pointed when the Multiplicity is on. When Blend is not on, an active multiplicity influences the shape and the tightness of the fillet by forcing a multiple knot insertion when on.

The fillet tends to be better behaved when multiplicity in on. However, this means that the resulting face or surface is built with a discontinuity at the connection points and might not lend itself to point modeling in that area too well.

Multiplicity has no effect on polygons and meshes.

Connect Closest Ends `proximity` - The Join SOP connects the tail of the first primitive with the head on the next primitive, and so on unless this toggle is on, in which case the closest ends are chosen instead. For surfaces, this option enables the proximity test in U or V, as specified in the Direction parameter below.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - This menu determines the parametric direction of the joining operation, which can be in U or in V, and is meaningful only when the inputs are surfaces. The U direction is associated with columns; the V direction refers to rows. For example, joining two surfaces in U will generate a surface with more columns than either input. The number of rows might be higher too, but only if the two inputs have a different number of rows or a different V basis.

Join `joinop` - ⊞ - Can optionally join subgroups of n primitives or every nth primitive in a cyclical manner.

**For Example**; assume there are six primitives numbered for 0 - 5, and N = 2. Then,

1. Groups will generate 0-1 2-3 4-5
2. Skipping will generate 0-2-6 and 1-3-5.

N `inc` - Determines the number of primitives to be either grouped or skipped. N2.
Wrap Last to First `loop` - If enabled, it connects the beginning of the first primitive to the end of the last primitive, thus forming a single, closed face or hull. If a single, open primitive exists in the input, it will be closed. The [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP") provides a more direct way of closing primitives but offers almost no shape controls.
Keep Primitives `prim` - If this button is not checked, the input primitives will be deleted after being joined. If checked, they will be preserved.

Joint SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Joint SOP

The Joint SOP will aid in the creation of circle-based skeletons by creating a series of circles between each pair of input circles. This SOP requires at least a pair of circles in order to work correctly.

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field causes the SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Divisions `divs` - Allows you to specify the number of circles between each pair of input circles.
Preserve First Input `preserve1` - Preserves the first input circle being fed into the SOP.
Preserve Last Input `preserve2` - Preserves the last input circle.
Orient Circles `orient` - This helps to create a joint that blends between the input circles without flattening or curving outwards. In order to do this, there may be a reversal of the normal of each input circle. For example, if the normals of the two input circles are facing away from each other, the joint created (if this option was not enabled) would appear to connect the circles the long way around. This option would reorient the joint such that the shorter distance is used to create the joint.
Smooth Path `smoothpath` - If not on, the joint circles are blended linearly. Otherwise, they are placed along a cubic piece-wise Bzier curve between the circle centres. This is useful when the input contains more than two circles and the joints must be continuous to each other. If this option isn't enabled, the interpolation may be sharper than desired.
Smooth Twist `smoothtwist` - Each joint circle is rotated slightly such that its X and Y axis align as it approaches an input circle. This toggle causes the adjustments to be an incremental, or piece-wise, Bzier function. Again this is useful for multi-circle inputs.
Align Major Axes `majoraxes` - If enabled, this option aligns the first circle's largest axis to the last circle's largest axis. If disabled, the first and last circles' x axes are aligned. This option can help minimize the twist in the joint ellipses between bones.
Minimum Twist `mintwist` - If on, the rotations of the added circles are calculated such that they never rotate further than one half turn in either direction. This leads to a visually continuous layout suitable for creating a skeleton, but will cause problems if the circles are later skinned since the beginnings of each circle may no longer be continuously aligned.
LR Scale `lrscale` - ⊞ - These parameters control the shape of the smooth path, varying the shape of the implied curve from the left or right. If the Orient Circles option is on, the sign of the scale has no effect. For a discussion of the relative terms right and left, see [Align SOP](Align_SOP.html "Align SOP").

LR Offset `lroffset` - ⊞ - These parameters allow you to override the distance between circles, thereby affecting the shape of the joint.

Joystick CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Joystick CHOP

The Joystick CHOP outputs values for all 6 possible axes on any game controller (joysticks, game controllers, driving wheels, etc.), as well as up to 32 button, 2 sliders and 4 POV Hats.

It handles game controllers connected to the gameport or USB ports, including the [3D Connexion](http://www.3dconnexion.com/) mouse. You can have several devices attached, and any number of Joystick CHOPs in a project per device.

Before you use the game controller on your computer, calibrate them using Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Gaming Options -> Properties.

The main two outputs, the X-axis and Y-axis are output through channels called xaxis and yaxis. The other four axes are output through channels with similar names.

The range of the values for each channel is 0 to 1. For any axis, a value 0.5 is considered "centered". A value of 0 is given if the axis doesn't exist.

For any button, a value of 0 means the button is up or doesn't exist. A value of 1 means the button is pressed.

POV Hats behave like an X and Y axis. A POV axis only has 3 values though, 0, 0.5 and 1.

JSON DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# JSON DAT

The JSON DAT converts and filters JSON text using [JSONPath](https://docs.derivative.ca/JSONPath "JSONPath") syntax and outputs the filtered results. It eliminates having to code scripts to parse and manipulate JSON, and keeps the data flow procedural.

It expects JSON text as input and converts the input to a Python object in the `DAT.source` member.

It then filters the JSON down using the [JSONPath Filter parameter](https://docs.derivative.ca/JSONPath "JSONPath"), and it outputs the resulting data from the DAT as JSON text.

It also puts the filtered results as `DAT.results` (a Python list of results) and `DAT.result` (the first result).

You can test expressions on `DAT.source`, `DAT.result` and `DAT.results` by setting the Output menu to Expression and using expressions like `me.result['city']`, which outputs the evaluated expression from the DAT. You can then use that expression as `op('json1').result['city']` in an expression elsewhere. `DAT.expr` is also a member of the JSON DAT, for example, `op('json1').expr` returns the evaluated expression parameter.

**Output tables**: The JSON DAT can output a table by setting the Output Format menu to Table. It will do its best to take the result of the JSON Filter and form rows and columns of values and headings in a DAT table. Any cell that can't be expressed as a simple string, integer, float or boolean will be left as the JSON string of the remainder. A cell or range of cells can be further reduced with a [Select DAT](Select_DAT.html "Select DAT") and then passed to another JSON DAT which can convert the JSON strings to a table.

**See also:** [JSONPath](https://docs.derivative.ca/JSONPath "JSONPath"), [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets"), and the [TDJSON](TDJSON.html "TDJSON") functions for converting and manipulating JSON data.

Keyboard In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Keyboard In CHOP

The Keyboard In CHOP receives ASCII input from the keyboard, and outputs channels for the number of keys specified. It creates a single-frame channel representing the current state of each key.

The channels for keys are created by specifying the first key, the number of keys to follow, and the order with which they are selected. Key channel names are either determined by the name of the key, or the channel number.

**NOTE:** The Keyboard In CHOP does not handle rapid repeats of characters and does not output channels or all keys. A better way is as follows: Create a [Panel Execute DAT](Panel_Execute_DAT.html "Panel Execute DAT"), and set the 'Panel' parameter to the panel in which keyboard keys need to be monitored.
Set the Panel Value to: `key`.
In this DAT, if you enter `print(panelValue)` in the onValueChange() callback, you will see a line printed for every keystroke.

Keyboard In DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Keyboard In DAT

The Keyboard In DAT lists the most recent key events in its FIFO (first in/first out) table. There is one row for every key press down and every key-up, including Shift, Ctrl and Alt, with distinction between left and right side. For convenience, with each key press, a column indicates if the Shift, Ctrl and Alt were being held down at the time.

You get key presses even of the cursor is outside the TouchDesigner windows, whether they are control panels, Perform Mode or the network editor window. Exceptions: while entering text in the editor window.

You can set a filter to watch only certain keys. Custom shortcuts can be defined and handled by a [python callback in the attached script](https://docs.derivative.ca/KeyboardinDAT_Class "KeyboardinDAT Class").

# Keyframe CHOP

The Keyframe CHOP uses channel and keys data in an [Animation COMP](Animation_COMP.html "Animation COMP") and creates channels of samples at a selectable sample rate (frames per second).

See also: [Animation COMP](Animation_COMP.html "Animation COMP") and [Animation Editor](Animation_Editor.html "Animation Editor")

The Keyframe CHOP lets you access the keyframed channel data inside an Animation component. The Animation CHOP allows the channels to be played back with the global frame or seconds index. It can be synced to the internal global beat clock, a specified index, or based on a timing or lookup channel sent into the input. It outputs all channels - either as a single sample or an entire start/end range.

To create/edit/delete keyframed channels, create an [Animation COMP](Animation_COMP.html "Animation COMP") and open the [Animation Editor](Animation_Editor.html "Animation Editor") by right-clicking on the component and selecting Edit Keyframes... from the pop-up menu. Inside the Animation component a Keyframe CHOP will be outputting the channels created in the editor.

Adding an input to the Keyframe CHOP now acts as a lookup index. In addition it outputs a proper [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") if its input is a Time Slice.

The lookup cycles through all the input channels, though only 1 is necessary.

Kinect Azure CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Kinect Azure CHOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows 10 April 2018 or newer** operating system.  
**Hardware:** [Kinect Azure System Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/system-requirements)

The Kinect Azure CHOP can be used to obtain body tracking information, including joint positions and rotations, and IMU sensor data from a Microsoft Kinect Azure camera or a Kinect compatible [Orbbec](Orbbec.html "Orbbec") Camera (Femto Mega, Femto Bolt, etc).

This CHOP requires a [Kinect Azure TOP](Kinect_Azure_TOP.html "Kinect Azure TOP") to connect to the camera and to configure the camera's settings. Not all configuration settings support body tracking e.g. Passive IR depth mode. Body tracking can only be used by one hardware type at a time (Microsoft or Orbbec). If more than one hardware type tries to use body tracking in a project, only the first node to be cooked will be enabled.

Use the Max Players parameter to determine how many players you would like the camera to track. The TOP will automatically assign any bodies that are discovered by the device to the available player spaces. Due to the system used to detect player skeletons from the depth camera image, body tracking data can lag multiple frames behind the image data. To more closely synchronize body and image data, use the 'Sync Body Tracking To Image' option on the primary [Kinect Azure TOP](Kinect_Azure_TOP.html "Kinect Azure TOP") that is controlling the device (synchronization will increase lag in the image capture).

For a diagram of the joints tracked and their hierarchy, visit [Microsoft's Kinect Azure SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-joints).

Acceleration and rotation data from the camera's IMU sensor can be obtained by enabling the 'IMU Channels' parameter.

## Parameters - Kinect Azure Page

Active `active` - Enable to disable the capturing of body tracking data. The primary [Kinect Azure TOP](Kinect_Azure_TOP.html "Kinect Azure TOP") must also be active to receive data.
Kinect Azure TOP `top` - The name of the [Kinect Azure TOP](Kinect_Azure_TOP.html "Kinect Azure TOP") that is connected to the camera.
Max Players `maxplayers` - The number of player skeletons that should be tracked by the device. If the camera does not find enough skeletons, then the extra channels will be set to zero.
Relative Bone Rotations `relbonerotations` - Include rotation data for all bone in the skeleton. Rotation is measured in degrees around the XYZ axes relative to the bone's parent.
Absolute Bone Rotations `absbonerotations` - Include absolute rotation data for all bone in the skeleton. Rotation is measured in degrees around the XYZ axes relative to the world.
Bone Lengths `bonelengths` - Include channels for the length of each bone. A bone's length is the distance between a joint and its parent joint. See the [Kinect Azure SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/system-requirements) for a diagram of the joint heirarchy.
World Space Positions `worldspace` - Include channels for the bone's absolute world position in meters.
Color Image Positions `colorspace` - Include channels for the skeleton positions in UV coordinates of the Color Image.
Depth Image Positions `depthspace` - Include channels for the skeleton positions in UV coordinates of the Depth Image.
Aspect Correct UVs `aspectcorrectuv` - Scale the image space positions to that they match the aspect ratio of the corresponding camera.
Mirror Image V Positions `flipimagev` - Flip the v coordinate of the image space positions so that 0,0 would be in the top-left corner. This was the default behaviour prior to version 2020.44130.
Mirror U Positions `flipskelu` - Mirror's the U coordintate of Color Image Positions and Depth Image Positions above which is useful when those images have been flipped in U (x axis flip like a mirror).
Bone Confidence `confidence` - The confidence that the sensor has that a joint's position and rotation is correct. It can be one of the following values:

* 0 - The joint is out of range (too far from the camera)
* 1 - The joint cannot be seen by the sensor and is predicted based on the neighbouring joints
* 2 - Medium confidence. The sensor is reasonably confident of the joint's position/rotation. This is currently the highest level of confidence the sensor will produce.
* 3 - High confidence. Reserved for future use.

IMU Channels `imuchans` - Include temperature, acceleration and rotation data from the camera's IMU sensor.

Kinect Azure TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Kinect Azure TOP

The Kinect Azure TOP can be used to configure and capture data from a Microsoft Kinect Azure camera or a Kinect compatible [Orbbec](Orbbec.html "Orbbec") camera (Femto Mega, Femto Bolt, etc).

The TOP can be used to configure the settings of the camera (resolution, frame rate, synchronization, etc) as well to retrieve captured images from either its color or depth cameras. Image data from one camera can be remapped (aligned) to the other camera in order to match color and depth information. Only one Kinect Azure TOP can be connected to a single Kinect camera. To retrieve additional images from the same camera, use a [Kinect Azure Select TOP](Kinect_Azure_Select_TOP.html "Kinect Azure Select TOP").

The Kinect Azure can also extract body tracking information and skeleton positions using the depth camera image. To access this data, use a [Kinect Azure CHOP](Kinect_Azure_CHOP.html "Kinect Azure CHOP") and set its Kinect TOP parameter to the primary Kinect Azure TOP that is connected to the device. **Note:** While both Microsoft and Orbbec hardware can be used in the same project, only one hardware type can have body tracking enabled at any one time. Body tracking is required for the Player Index image or to obtain skeleton data. If body tracking is not required from the Orbbec, it is recommended to use the native [Orbbec TOP](Orbbec_TOP.html "Orbbec TOP") instead.

**Note:** The Orbbec Femto Mega does not automatically support ethernet connections using the Kinect Azure TOP or CHOP. However, you can enable detection of ethernet devices using an external configuration file places alongside your toe file. For further information on the file see the [Orbbec documentaion](https://www.orbbec.com/documentation-mega/k4a-access-femtomega-network-mode/).

**Warning:** When working with Orbbec hardware, using both Kinect Azure and Orbbec nodes in the same project may lead to instability. It is recommended to use either all Kinect Azure or all Orbbec nodes depending on project requirements.

**TIP:** See Elburz' video on using KinectAzure's point clouds and a bunch of Azure general tips. [Kinect Azure Point Cloud in TouchDesigner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_PjAr2Yzao) on the Interactive and Immersive HQ.

Body Tracking GPU Device `gpu` - The device number of the GPU to use when there are multiple GPUs in the system. The ordering system may be dependent on the GPU manufacturer.
Sensor Orientation `orientation` - ⊞ - Used to indicate when the camera is mounted in a non-upright position. This can help improve body-tracking results.

* Default `default` -

* Clockwise 90 Degrees `cw90` -

* Counterclockwise 90 Degrees `ccw90` -

* Flipped 180 Degrees `flipped` -

Image `image` - ⊞ - A list of available image types to capture from the device and display in this TOP. All image types have a second version that is mapped (aligned) to the image space of the other camera so that color and depth image data can be matched. The resolution of the image is controlled by the Color Resolution or Depth Mode parameters depending on the type of image selected. Use a [Kinect Azure Select TOP](Kinect_Azure_Select_TOP.html "Kinect Azure Select TOP") to access additional image types from the same camera.

* Depth aligned to Color `depthremap` - The depth image remapped to align with the current color camera image. The resolution is determined by the Color Resolution parameter.

Align Image to Other Camera `remapimage` - When enabled, the current image will be remapped to align with images from the other camera. For example, use this feature to create a color camera image that maps to the pixels of the depth camera.

The current depth mode and color resolution will be used to do the remapping.
Note: Remapping the point cloud image can create artifacts in the distribution of points due to gaps in the remapping algorithm.

Sync Image to Body Tracking `bodyimage` - When enabled, the image produced will be delayed so that it corresponds to the most recent data in the body tracking system. The amount of delay may fluctuate based on the power of the processor doing the body tracking and the complexity of the scene. A [Kinect Azure Select TOP](Kinect_Azure_Select_TOP.html "Kinect Azure Select TOP") can be used at the same time to retrieve the real-time image stream.
Mirror Image `mirrorimage` - Flip the image in the horizontal axis.
CPU Body Tracking `cpu` - When enabled, body tracking calculations will be done on the CPU rather than on the graphics card. This method is much slower, but does not require a high-powered graphics card to function.

## Parameters - Color Page

Use the controls on the Color page to adjust the output of the color camera.

Reset Color Controls `resetcolors` - Reset all of the color controls to the camera's defaults. These vary per camera and may be different than the parameter defaults.
Enable Color Controls `enablecolors` - Turn on to enable adjustment controls for the color camera. When disabled, the previous color settings will remain in place. Use the Reset Color Controls button to switch the camera back to its default settings.
Manual Exposure `manualexposure` - Enable to allow setting the exposure time manually. When disabled, the camera will automatically choose an exposure based on the light levels and frame rate.

Note: This feature may not work correctly due to issues in the current Kinect SDK.

Kinect CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Kinect CHOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This CHOP only supports the **Kinect for Windows** hardware and the **Kinect 2**, *not* Kinect for Xbox hardware.

The Kinect CHOP reads positional and skeletal tracking data from the Kinect and Kinect2 sensors. Up to 6 people's full skeletons can be tracked (2 on the original Kinect), and the center position of an addition 4 people in the camera view is tracked as well. Multiple Kinect devices can be used by using multiple Kinect CHOPs and changing the Camera parameter.

It also supports face tracking.

To use a Kinect 2 device you need to install the Kinect 2 SDK or runtime from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/).

To use the original Kinect 1 you will need to install the [Kinect Runtime 1.8](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40277) for builds greater than 12000, or [Kinect Runtime 1.7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36997) for builds below 12000.
Multiple Kinects: The Kinect 2 SDK does not allow for multiple kinects to be used on one system at a time. There is no way to connect to different devices through the SDK. The Kinect 1 can do this, but not the 2.

## Parameters - Kinect Page

Active `active` - When 'On' data is captured from the Kinect sensor.
Hardware Version `hwversion` - ⊞ - Choose between Kinect v1 or Kinect v2 sensors.

* Version 1 `version1` -

* Version 2 `version2` -

Sensor `sensor` - Selects which Kinect sensor to use. Only available when using Kinect v1.
Skeleton `skeleton` - ⊞ - Selects options for skeletal tracking.

* Full `full` - Track full skeleton.

* Seated `seated` - Track seated skeleton.

* Off `off` - Do not track skeleton.

Max Players `maxplayers` - Limits how many players to track.
Interactions `interactions` - Enables interactions, which returns interaction data such as "grip" and "press". The additional channels output are prefixed with `p[1-2]/hand_l_*` and `p[1-2]/hand_r_*`.<

* For the x and y values of the interaction hand, 0.0 corresponds to left edge of interaction region and 1.0 corresponds to right edge of interaction region, but values could be outside of this range.
* For the z value of the interaction hand, 0.0 means that hand is close to shoulder and 1.0 represents a fully extended arm, but values could be outside of this range.

**NOTE:** Interaction mode requires a depth resolution of 640x480. As such, a [Kinect TOP](Kinect_TOP.html "Kinect TOP") displaying a depth image for the same sensor will output an image with a resolution of 640x480 and the Near Depth Mode setting will be set in the Kinect CHOP.

For guidelines in creating applications with Kinect Interaction, download the [Kinect for Windows Human Interface Guidelines](http://download.microsoft.com/download/B/0/7/B070724E-52B4-4B1A-BD1B-05CC28D07899/Human_Interface_Guidelines_v1.7.0.pdf).

Relative Bone Rotations `relbonerotations` - Returns rx, ry, and rz relative rotation channels for each bone. The rotation is relative to the previous joint.
Absolute Bone Rotations `absbonerotations` - Returns rx, ry, and rz absolute rotation channels for each bone.
Bone Lengths `bonelengths` - Returns the length for each bone.
Unroll Bone Values `unrollbones` - Return the rx, ry, and rz values in a form that includes no discontinuities (or wrap arounds), so that they can be safely blended, filtered, lagged etc. For example, a rotation value running from 0 to 360 continuously, unrolled would start at 0 and increase in value indefinitely.
World Space Positions `worldspace` - Returns the tracked positions in world space coordinates. For each tracked point, a `tx`, `ty`, `tz` triplet of channels will be output.
Color Space Positions `colorspace` - Returns the tracked positions in image space coordinates relative to the color camera. For each tracked point, a `u`, `v`, `tz` triplet of channels will be output. Note this is only available on Kinectv2.
Depth Space Positions `depthspace` - Returns the tracked positions in image space coordinates relative to the depth camera. For each tracked point, a `depthu`, `depthv`, `tz` triplet of channels will be output. Works on both Kinectv1 and Kinectv2.
Face Tracking `facetracking` - Returns face tracking channels for detected faces.
Status Channels `statuschans` - A number of additional status channels are reported when this is turned on. A group of channels will report if a joint is currently being tracked, and another group of channels reports if part of the player is clipped outside the bounds of the Kinect sensor. The additional channels output are suffixed with `tracked` or `clipped`.
Near Depth Mode `neardepthmode` - Enables near mode for skeleton tracking, which allows the depth camera to see objects as close as 40cm to the camera (instead of the default 80cm).
Flip Skeleton U Direction `flipskelu` - Flips the u-axis for skeleton channels, helpful when using a mirror image from the camera.
Flip Face U Direction `flipfaceu` - Flips the u-axis for face channels, helpful when using a mirror image from the camera.

## Parameters - Smoothing Page

Joint Smoothing `jointsmoothing` - Activates Kinect's smoothing algorithm for joint tracking and enables the smoothing parameters below.
Smoothing `smoothing` - Increasing the smoothing parameter value leads to more highly-smoothed skeleton position values being returned. It is the nature of smoothing that, as the smoothing value is increased, responsiveness to the raw data decreases. Thus, increased smoothing leads to increased latency in the returned skeleton values. Values must be in the range 0 through 1.0. Passing 0 causes the raw data to be returned.
Correction `correction` - Lower values are slower to correct towards the raw data and appear smoother, while higher values will correct toward the raw data more quickly. Values must be in the range 0 through 1.0.
Prediction `prediction` - The number of frames to predict into the future. Values must be greater than or equal to zero. Values greater than 0.5 will likely lead to overshooting when moving quickly. This effect can be damped by using small values of Max Deviation Radius.
Jitter Radius `jitterrad` - The radius in meters for jitter reduction. Any jitter beyond this radius is clamped to the radius.
Max Deviation Radius `maxdevrad` - The maximum radius in meters that filtered positions are allowed to deviate from raw data. Filtered values that would be more than this radius from the raw data are clamped at this distance, in the direction of the filtered value.
Rotation Smoothing `rotationsmoothing` - Activates Kinect's smoothing algorithm for rotations. As with joint smoothing above, higher levels of smoothing will introduce more latency.

# Kinect TOP

The Kinect TOP captures video from the [Kinect](Kinect.html "Kinect") depth camera or RGB color camera.

To use a Kinect 2 device you need to install the [Kinect for Windows 2.0 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=44561) or [runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=44559).

To use the original Kinect 1 device you will need to install the [Kinect Runtime 1.8](http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40277) for builds greater than 12000, or [Kinect Runtime 1.7](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36997) for builds below 12000.

Kinect 2 supports color point clouds - getting the camera space positions of the color pixels, outputted as a 32-bit float RGB texture with XYZ in RGB. For use in making point clouds renders.

Sensor `sensor` - Selects which Kinect sensor to use. Only available when using Kinect v1.
Image `image` - ⊞ - Selects between the Color, Depth, Infrared, Player Index, or Color Point Cloud modes.

* Color `color` - Uses the raw image from the RGB camera.

* Depth `depth` - Textures the range is from 0-1 where a pixel with a value of 1 means the pixel is 8.191 meters from the camera.

* Raw Depth `rawdepth` -

* Infrared `infrared` - Uses the raw image from the infrared camera.

* Player Index `playerindex` - The pixel value will be in increments of 0.1 for each player number. I.e a pixel with value ~0.1 will be player 1, ~0.2 will be player 2, etc. The reason is it approximate 0.1 (~) is because the buffer is 8-bit which can't exactly express 0.1, 0.3 etc. So 0.1 \* 255 = 25.5 which could round off to a pixel value of 25 or 26 (out of 255).

* (-INF, -INF, -INF) `neginfinite` -

# Lag CHOP

The Lag CHOP adds lag and overshoot to channels. It can also limit the velocity and acceleration of channels. Lag slows down rapid changes in the input channels. Overshoot amplifies the changes in the input channels.

Two values exist for each parameter. For example, in the Lag effect, when the input channel value is rising, the first lag parameter is used, and when the channel value is decreasing, the second lag parameter is used. This can give a quick rise, and a slow fall. But lag up and down are often kept at the same value.

For a similar, less-abrupt effect, see the [Filter CHOP](Filter_CHOP.html "Filter CHOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[lagCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/LagCHOP_Class "LagCHOP Class")

Laser CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Laser CHOP

The Laser CHOP produces channels that can drive a laser projector. It uses the points and lines of a SOP or CHOP and outputs the channels at a specified sample rate, typically 10,000 to 96,000 samples per second. The Laser CHOP gives optimal control over the movement of the reflectors of the laser projector as well as enhanced color control. In particular, it gives better control of lines being straight, end-points being not cut off or over-drawn, and eliminating tails, all adjustable using a set of parameters.

When sending CHOP channels to the Laser CHOP, the CHOP expects `x` and `y` channels and every sample will be interpreted as a point to be drawn. To draw multiple shapes, also specify a channel named `id` to identify each shape. Points with `id = 0` are part of the first shape, points with `id = 1` form the second shape. All other channels will be interpreted as color channels and blanking will be applied to those. This makes it possible to drive lasers that have more than just RGB diodes active.

The channels output from the Laser CHOP can be sent to the [Laser Device CHOP](Laser_Device_CHOP.html "Laser Device CHOP") in case of controlling a Laser via the [ILDA Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Laser_Display_Association), or the [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP") in case of using one of LaserAnimation Sollinger's [AVB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Bridging) capable devices, where the audio is output via the [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP") to a low-latency AVB-ready audio device like those from MOTU, RME, LaserAnimation Sollinger or Apple macOS.

[LaserAnimation Sollinger's AVB2ILDA devices](https://laseranimation.com/en/products/avb-devices) give you access to features for the professional sector including 24-bit resolution on the X/Y signal and all color channels. Additionally the AVB2ILDA device includes software for electronic masking, making it possible to limit the laser output for certain areas (for example to protect scanning areas such as auditoriums or sectors with optical equipment). Also packaged is a color correction tool that includes individual control of the color delay for 3 colors as well as a Digital Geometric Correction to allow for projection on for example uneven surfaces.

The CHOP was developed with the help of [LaserAnimation Sollinger](https://laseranimation.com/en/) who guided us in speccing and implementing the necessary parameters, especially in regards of the blanking timing settings.

**LASERS ARE DANGEROUS - DAMAGE TO YOUR OR THE AUDIENCE'S EYE SIGHT IS A VERY REAL RISK**

* If you plan to use lasers

1. Understand all the laws and regulations for laser operation in your area.
2. Become a certified Laser Safety Officer (this is required by law in some areas). Courses are available from ILDA directly: [ILDA Laser Safety Courses](https://www.ilda.com/LSOcourse.htm)

* Make sure an emergency stop button is close to you at all times.
* Do not let anyone enter the laser projection area unless all precautions have been taken to limit the output.
* Make sure there are no reflective surfaces in the projection area that might cause the beam to reflect unintendedly.

(The Laser CHOP replaces the legacy Scan CHOP.)

## Parameters - Laser Page

Active `active` - When disabled, the CHOP will zero out all channels.
Source OP `source` - ⊞ - Select the source operator type for the laser image.

* SOP `sop` - Use a SOP as the source for the Laser image. Appart from position attributes, the SOP's point color attributes are used to determine the color output.

* CHOP `chop` - Use a CHOP as the source for the laser image. The CHOP expects `x` and `y` channels and every sample will be interpreted as a point to be drawn. To draw multiple shapes, also specify a channel named `id` to identify each shape. Points with `id = 0` are part of the first shape, points with `id = 1` form the second shape. All other channels will be interpreted as color channels and blanking will be applied to those. This makes it possible to drive lasers that have more than just RGB diodes active.

SOP `sop` - Path to the SOP.
CHOP `chop` - Path to the CHOP. The input CHOP must have **x**, **y** channels for the point positions. In addition, it also supports **z**, **r**, **g**, **b**, and **id** channels. The **id** channel is used for grouping points together as a single shape. By default when no **id** channel is present, each point is separate and unconnected. Additional and arbitrarily named colour channels may be added for laser projectors that accept more than just r, g, b.
Input Sample Rate `inputrate` - Specify the Sample Rate the input source will be sampled at. This can be lower than the output sample rate. If lower than the output sample rate then the output will be resampled (same as if put through a Resample CHOP).
Output Sample Rate `outputrate` - The sample rate of the CHOP, and the sample rate at which it will output to the laser. With the default 48000 samples per second and a 60fps frame rate, the Laser CHOP can output 800 position and color values per frame.
Swap Output `swap` - Lets you swap the x and y axis of the output.
X Scale `xscale` - Control the horizontal scale of the output.
Y Scale `yscale` - Control the vertical scale of the output.
Rotate `rotate` - Control the rotation of the output.
Update Method `updatemethod` - ⊞ - Control how the Laser CHOP pulls data from its source.

In most cases you will want to keep this at the default setting "When All Points Drawn".

There is a specific usage case that requires the "Every Frame" update method. Background is that the Laser CHOP might have to draw the input values over multiple frames. For example given a source with 200 sampling values. After applying all blanking and step sizes at a certain sample rate, the Laser might need more than one frame to draw the full image. The effect will be visible by the Laser image flickering. With the default setting, the Laser will grab a new set of samples from its input once it has completed drawing all previous values. With the "Every Frame" update method, the Laser will grab the updated values for the remaining samples after each frame.

* When All Points Drawn `alldrawn` - The Laser CHOP will read the source data once all points of the previous frame have been drawn.

* Every Frame `everyframe` - The Laser CHOP will update the input every frame, no matter if it finished drawing the previous frame or not.

Frame Start Pulse `startpulse` - When enabled, will insert a sample with all colors set to -1 at the beginning of the laser frame.
Vertex Order `vertexorder` - Output the points in the same order as the vertices of each polygon, instead of the order in which the points are defined in the geometry.
Step Size `stepsize` - The distance each x,y can change while outputing color.
Blanking Step Size `bstepsize` - The distance each x,y can change while not outputing color (blanking).
Minimum Vertex Hold `minverthold` - The minimum value of the vertex hold of a point. The value of the vertex hold of a point is calculated linearly in the range from the minimum to maximum vertex hold, based on the steepness of the angle at the point. This angle is calculated with the following three points: the previous point, the point itself, and the next point. Example: when the angle at the point is 180 degrees then the vertex hold of the point will be the minimum value.
Maximum Vertex Hold `maxverthold` - The maximum value of the vertex hold of a point. See Minimum Vertex Hold for more details. When the angle at the point is 0 degrees, then the vertex hold will be the maximum value. If the maximum value is lower than the minimum then the maximum will be clamped upward.
Camera `camera` - Specify the path to a Camera COMP used to draw a SOP from the cameras view.

These parameters let you control how the color channels for the Laser are created. Especially paying attention to the blanking settings which will have to be adjusted matching the capabilities of your laser projector.

Blanking is the capability of a laser projector to rapidly turn on / off the laser when displaying animations. For example when displaying multiple shapes, the laser needs the ability of blanking to omit the empty spots between the shapes.
As the laser's mirrors are driven by motors, the positional data that is send to the laser is likely to be ahead of the actual mirror position - the mirror must catch up to the data. The Color data though is in time and as a result the effect can be visible tails at points where the laser switches off its color. Adjusting the blanking parameters can help prevent this.

Red Scale `redscale` - Set the intensity of the Red Channel.
Green Scale `greenscale` - Set the intensity of the Green Channel.
Blue Scale `bluescale` - Set the intensity of the Blue Channel.
Pre Blanking On Delay `preblankon` - Set the time in ms the Laser should wait at a position before turning the color output off.
Post Blanking On Delay `postblankon` - Set the time in ms the Laser should wait at a position after turning the color output off.
Pre Blanking Off Delay `preblankoff` - Set the time in ms the Laser should wait at a position before turning the color output on.
Post Blanking Off Delay `postblankoff` - Set the time in ms the Laser should wait at a position after turning the color output on.

Laser Device CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Laser Device CHOP

The Laser Device CHOP can send laser points to supported laser devices: EtherDream, Helios, and ShowNET. The devices can be connected to a laser using an ILDA cable, except in the case of ShowNET when an onboard DAC is used. Applications of the Laser Device CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.

(The Laser Device CHOP replaces the deprecated [EtherDream CHOP](EtherDream_CHOP.html "EtherDream CHOP") and [Helios DAC CHOP](Helios_DAC_CHOP.html "Helios DAC CHOP").)

**Input/Output Channels:**

* **x:** the point's X position, between -1 and 1.
* **y:** the point's Y position, between -1 and 1.
* **r:** the point's red color component, between 0 and 1.
* **g:** the point's green color component, between 0 and 1.
* **b:** the point's blue color component, between 0 and 1.
* **i:** the point's color intensity, between 0 and 1.
* **user1:** Optional user field 1. Supported by EtherDream and ShowNET.
* **user2:** Optional user field 2. Supported by EtherDream and ShowNET.
* **user3:** Optional user field 3. Supported by ShowNET.
* **user4:** Optional user field 4. Supported by ShowNET.

For EtherDream IP discover use the [EtherDream DAT](EtherDream_DAT.html "EtherDream DAT").

Helios/ShowNET both have auto-populating menus for attached devices.

### Debugging

If the Laser Device CHOP has trouble connecting to an EtherDream device, then try lowering the queue size parameter. The queue size parameter directly controls the size of the point buffer on the EtherDream device, and if it exceeds the max point buffer size then it will put the device into an error state. To check if the device is in this error state, look at response code returned through the Info CHOP. If it is flickering back and forth from 97 (OK), then that means it is continuously and repeatedly exceeding its max buffer size, causing a device reset. EtherDream 2 devices will suffer from this problem more than newer EtherDream models, because it has a smaller max point buffer size.

Lattice SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Lattice SOP

The Lattice SOP allows you to create animated deformations of its input geometry by manipulating grids or a subdivided box that encloses the input source's geometry.

It is much easier to deform an object by moving a few grids than trying to animate every single point of an object.

This SOP has very few buttons and looks simple, but it is important to understand how it works. The first input, called **Geometry to Deform**, is for the geometry you wish to deform. The second input, called **Rest Geometry**, must be an evenly spaced grid which fully encloses the geometry to deform. The third input, called **Deformed Geometry**, is a copy of the initial grid that is altered in some way, either by moving parts of it with animation channels, dragging its points in the Model Editor, or by running it through a [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html "Spring SOP") which distorts it with the forces which simulate the laws of physics. Lattice computes a deformation based on the difference between the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry, and applies it to the input geometry. The output of the SOP is the deformation of the geometry in the input source. If the Deformed Geometry is being animated, the output will also bend, twist and stretch every frame.

  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Lattice Page

Group `group` - Subset of points in the first input to be deformed. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Deform Type `deformtype` - ⊞ - Choose if deformation should be done using a regularly spaced lattice or an arbitary point cloud.

* Lattice `lattice` - Deform with a regularly spaced lattice.

Both the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry must be lattices with the point orders in a specified order. This is the order generated by the Box SOP when Use Divisions is turned on. The number of divisions must match that of the goemetry or an error is returned.

* Points `points` - Deform using an arbitrary point clouds.

Both the Rest Geometry and the Deformed Geometry must have the same point clouds. Note that any points not within the specified radius of a point in the Rest Geometry will not be deformed. The amount of deformation applied to a point is based upon the weighted average of the deltas of the Rest Geometry to the Deformed Geometry. The weighting function is taken from the specified metaball kernal, so behavior is similar to applying a magnet metaball to every point in the Rest Geometry.

Divisions `divs` - ⊞ - Must be set to match the number of divisions in the lattice grid object(s).

Kernel Function `kernel` - ⊞ - Deformation by specifying a Kernal Function and Points makes it easier to deform arbitrary clouds of points, as this makes the topology of the lattice behave more like a metaball rather than as a fixed lattice. *Kernel Function* determines which meta kernel to use to determine the influence of a point. For more information on kernel types check here: [Metaball Model Types](Metaball.html#Metaball_Model_Types "Metaball")

* Wyvill model `wyvill` -

* Elendt model `elendt` -

* Blinn model `blinn` -

* Links model `links` -

Radius `radius` - The size of the points capture regions.

* Input 0:  - Geometry to deform.
* Input 1:  - Rest Geometry.
* Input 2:  - Deformed Geometry.

Layout TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Layout TOP

The Layout TOP positions multiple input TOPs into rows, columns, or grids. It can either fit all the TOPs into a specific resolution (determined by the Common page) by scaling the inputs, or it can scale its own resolution to be larger to accomodate the native resolution of the inputs.

Each input image gets equal area of the output, and the Fit menu determines how each image fits into its designated area.

Multiple inputs can be wired into the Layout TOP, or the TOP parameter can contain paths to multiple TOPs. In the final layout, the TOPs specified in the TOP parameter will appear before the TOPs of the wired inputs if both are used.

TOP `top` - Specify the path(s) to a TOP to include in the layout.
Scale Resolution `scaleres` - When 'off', the resolution of the first wired input is used, or a custom resolution can be specified on the Common page. When 'on' and the output resolution is 'Use Input', the Layout TOP's resolution is the first input's resolution scaled up by number of columns horiontally, and the number of rows vertically. For example, if there are 4 input textures and the first one is 1280x720 and Align Left to Right is selected, then the grid size is 4x1 and so the final resolution will be 5120x720 (ie. (1280\*4)x(720\*1)). However whether off or on, each texture gets an allotted space of the same size. How the texture fits into that space is determined using the Fit parameter.
Align `align` - ⊞ - The menu determines how the inputs are laid out, in row, column , or grid format.

Fit `fit` - ⊞ - Determines how the input images are fit to the space they are given. Depending on the setting, it will either fit the entire image inside the space given or crop some of the image off.

* Fill `fill` -

* Fit Horizontal `fithorz` -

* Fit Vertical `fitvert` -

* Fit Best `fitbest` -

* Fit Outside `fitoutside` -

* Native Resolution `nativeres` -

Max Rows `maxrows` - Maximum number of rows until a new column is started.
Max Columns `maxcols` - Maximum number of columns until a new row is started.
Border Color `bcolor` - ⊞ - The color of the border around each input.

* Red `bcolorr` -

* Green `bcolorg` -

* Blue `bcolorb` -

* Alpha `bcolora` -

Borders `borders` - ⊞ - The border width for each input. The borders will scale down the input.

* Left `bordersl` -

* Right `bordersr` -

* Bottom `bordersb` -

* Top `borderst` -

Background Color `bgcolor` - ⊞ - Color and alpha for the space not covered by the input images.

Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - This option allows the Background Color to be pre-multiplied by alpha.
Comp Over Background Color `compover` - Fill any area with the background color if it has alpha less than 1.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - The two fields for Translate allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes for each input image.

Translate Unit `tunit` -
Rotate `rotate` - The field for rotation allows you to specify the amount of rotation for each input image.
Scale `s` - ⊞ - The two fields for Scale allows you to specify transforms in x and y axes for each input image.

Legacy Transform `legacyxform` - When enabled, will use the legacy method of building the transform matrix, which has inverted rotation and transform order.

`curPass` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> The current cooking pass iteration, beginning at 0. The total can be set with the 'Passes' parameter on the operator's common page.

> True if the operators is a TOP.

`newestSliceWOffset` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> When a Texture3D TOP fills it's contents, it keeps track of the newest slice it's filled so texturing can be offset this so a '0' coordinate results in the first slice. This member give you access to this value.

`pixelFormat` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

`sample(x=None,y=None,z=None,u=None,v=None,w=None)`→ `Tuple[float, float, float, float]`:

> Returns a 4-tuple representing the color value at the specified texture location. One horizontal and one vertical component must be specified. Note that this is a very expensive operation currently. It will always stall the graphics pipeline if the TOP is currently queued to get updated, and then downloads the entire texture (not just the requested pixel). Use this for debugging and non-realtime workflows only.

> ```

`numpyArray(delayed=False, writable=False)`→ `numpy.ndarray`:

> Returns the TOP image as a Python NumPy array. Note that since NumPy arrays are referenced by line first, pixels are addressed as [h, w]. Currently data will always be in floating point, regardless of what the texture data format is on the GPU.
> 
> * delayed - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the download results will be delayed until the next call to numpyArray(), avoiding stalling the GPU waiting for the result immediately. This is useful to avoid long stalls that occur if immediately asking for the result. Each call with return the image that was 'current' on the previous call to numpyArray(). None will be returned if there isn't a result available. You should always check the return value against None to make sure you have a result. Call numpyArray() again, ideally on the next frame or later, to get the result. If you always need a result, you can call numpyArray() a second time in the event None is returned on the first call.
> * writable - (Keyword, Optional) If set to True, the memory in the numpy array will be allocated in such a way that writes to it arn't slow. By default the memory the numpy array holds can be allocated in such a way that is very slow to write to. Note that in either case, writing to the numpy array will \*not\* change the data in the TOP.

`save(filepath, asynchronous=False, createFolders=False, quality=1.0, metadata=[])`→ `str`:

> Saves the image to a bytearray object in the requested file format. Support file formats are: .tif, .tiff, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .png, .exr and .dds. Returns the bytearray object. To get the raw image data use `numpyArray()` or `cudaArray()` instead.
> 
> * filetype - (Optional) A string specifying the file type to save as. If not given the default file type '.tiff' will be used. Just the suffix of the string is used to determine the file type. E.g '.tiff', 'file.tiff', 'C:/Files/file.tiff' will all work. **Suffix must include the period**.

`cudaMemory(stream=None)`→ `CUDAMemory`:

> Copies the contents of the TOP to a newly allocated block of raw CUDA memory. The CUDA memory will be deallocated when the returned [CUDAMemory](CUDAMemory_Class.html "CUDAMemory Class") object is deallocated. Ensure you keep a reference to the returned object around as long as you are using it.
> 
> * stream - (Optional) A CUDA stream handle to synchronize the operation with. Any CUDA subsequent operations occurring on this stream will wait for this CUDA memory to be filled before executing their operation. If this is left as None, then the default CUDA stream will be used (which results in poor performance).

Leap Motion CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Leap Motion CHOP

The Leap Motion CHOP reads hand, finger, tool and gesture data from the [Leap Motion](Leap_Motion.html "Leap Motion") controller. It outputs hand, finger and tool positions, rotations and 'tracking' channels that indicate if these values are currently being detected and updated. Currently only 1 Leap Motion device can be connected at a time.

To connect with the device you will need to install the Ultraleap Tracking Software. For best performance, it is recommended to use the latest version Gemini drivers for Windows (v5.13.2 or greater) or MacOS (v5.14.0 or greater) that are available here: <https://developer.leapmotion.com/tracking-software-download>. Legacy version 2 or version 4 Orion drivers are also supported. See the API parameter details below for more information.

In addition to installing the driver, TouchDesigner must also be told where to find the tracking library. Installation instructions vary depending on the operating system:

**On Windows:** You can use the Library Folder parameter to point to the location of the LeapC.dll (Orion/Gemini) or Leap.dll (Version 2/3) files on your system. The file is installed as part of the LeapSDK and the location may vary depending on the version and options selected during installation.

**On MacOS:** The library folder should point to the location of the Ultraleap tracking app. By default this is '/Applications/Ultraleap Hand Tracking.app' TouchDesigner will automatically find the library files inside the application's contents folder.

**Tip:** If using Gemini V5, the Leap Motion will only work in one orientation. By default the hands enter from the bottom of the camera view, though this can be changed in setting to invert the direction. This is an important distinction between Gemini V5 and the older V2/V4 APIs which could work in either orientation.

**Note:** TouchDesigner does not include a license to use the Leap Motion hardware or software. Make sure to check with the [UltraLeap website](https://www.ultraleap.com/) regarding any applicable licenses that you may need for your project.

* `keytap*:t[xyz]` - Coordinates of the Key Tap Gesture relative to the sensor.

Screen Tap Gestures `screentapgestures` - Number of screen tap gestures, which is recognized as a quick forward tapping movement by a tool or finger. The following channels will be included for each detected screen tap gesture:

* `screentap*:handindex` - Index of the hand associated with the gesture. See Notes.
* `screentap*:fingerindex` - Index of the finger associated with the gesture. See Notes.
* `screentap*:t[xyz]` - Coordinates of the Screen Tap Gesture relative to the sensor.

**NOTES:** Rotation order is `Rx Ry Rz`. All vectors are given in the following [coordinate system](http://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/Languages/C++/Guides/Leap_Overview.html#coordinate-system).

For gestures, if `handindex` is 1, then channels with the prefix `hand1` contain the data for the hand associated with the gesture. If `handindex` is -1 it means there are no channels available for the hand associated with the gesture. The same follows for `fingerindex`.

Data for all indexed prefixes (`hand*`, `hand/finger*`, etc.) will continue to correspond to the same hand/finger/tool/gesture as long as the Leap Motion sensor is detecting it.

Limits for hands/fingers/tools/gestures will filter data from the Leap Motion sensor if there are more than the specified limit detected.

Extra Information for the Leap Motion CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Lens Distort TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Lens Distort TOP

The Lens Distort TOP applies or removes lens distortion from an image using the [Brown-Conrady model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(optics)). This can be used to rectify images taken from a physical camera, to apply distortion to a rendering for use in augmented reality (AR), or as a visual effect.

The distortion algorithm used by the Lens Distort TOP can be broken down into three components: radial distortion, tangential distortion and the camera matrix.

Radial distortion shifts pixels in the output relative to their distance from the center of the image (defined by the Optical Center parameter). Radial distortion is controlled by the k1, k2 and k3 constants, with k1 having the greatest effect and k3 the least. Positive k values create a barrel or fisheye effect as if the image was wrapped around the surface of a sphere. Negative k values will bend the image inward to create a pincushion or pillow effect. The equations for radial distortion are:

```
x_distorted = x * (1 + k1 * r^2 + k2 * r^4 + k3 * r^6)

y_distorted = y * (1 + k1 * r^2 + k2 * r^4 + k3 * r^6)

where, 
  r = distance from center
```

Tangential distortion shifts pixels as if they were on a surface being tilted away from the camera and is controlled by the p1 and p2 parameters. p1 tilts the image up and down depending on the sign, and p2 tilts the image left and right. The equations for tangential distortion are:

```
x_distorted = x + (2 * p1 * x * y + p2 * (r^2 + 2 * x^2))

y_distorted = y + (p1 * (r^2 + 2 * y^2) + 2 * p2 * x * y)

The camera matrix is defined by the Optical Center and Focal Length parameters and is used to transform the image positions before the distortion is applied. The Optical Center values control where the center of the distortion effect is, while the Focal Length parameters act as a scale on the other effects. The camera matrix is usually represented as a 3x3 matrix:

```
fx 0  cx
0  fy cy
0  0  1

Distortion values for a camera lens can be determined using [OpenCV calibration routines](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html) or through functions for a particular camera (see [kinectazureTOP class](https://docs.derivative.ca/KinectazureTOP_Class "KinectazureTOP Class")).

  Tangential Distortion, p2 < 0

The Layout page has parameters to control how the distorted (or undistorted) image is arranged inside the output image frame. These features can be helpful to preserve parts of the input image that might otherwise be projected offscreen, to preserve input image resolution, or to establish a consistent output frame when lens distortion parameters are changing.

For example, setting the Post Transform parameter to Optimal and keeping Optimal Alpha at 1, the distorted image will be scaled and shifted so that the entire input image is kept within the output frame. Switching the Layout parameter to Native Resolution, will then scale the output resolution so that no detail from the input image is lost. Attaching an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") will provide Region of Interest (ROI) bounds that can be used to crop out the original distorted image from the output image.

## Parameters - LensDistort Page

Invert Distortion `invert` - Reverse the lens distortion. This will \*mostly\* undo the distortion applied by another Lens Distort TOP with the same parameters and Inverse disabled. The lens distortion algorithm does not have a precise inverse solution, so an approximate method is used which may not match the original image precisely. The quality of the approximation varies depending on the magnitude of the distortion. Additionally, the approximation aglorithm does not use the k3 constant and any content that was lost outside the bounds of the image cannot be recreated.
K1 `k1` - The first radial distortion constant. The k constants move pixels towards or away from the center of the image. Values greater than 0 produce a barrel or fisheye effect, while values less than zero produce a pillow or pincushion effect. k1 has a larger effect than k3.
K2 `k2` - The second radial distortion constant. See K1.
P1 `p1` - The first tangential distortion constant. Tilts the image up and down.
P2 `p2` - The second tangential distortion constant. Tilts the image left or right.
K3 `k3` - The third radial distortion constant (not used in the inverse distortion). See K1.
Optical Center `center` - ⊞ - The position in the image that should be the center of the distortion. Depending on the unit mode selected, the position can be entered as an absolute position measured from the bottom-left corner, or as a relative position measured from the center of the image. The unit mode also controls whether the position is measured in pixels or normalized coordinates.

* Optical Center `center1` -

* Optical Center `center2` -

Optical Center Units `centerunit` - ⊞ -

* R `relative` - The optical center is measured in normalized coordinates from -0.5 to -0.5 relative to the center of the image.

* A `absolute` - The optical center is measured in normalized coordinates (0 to 1) from the bottom-left corner of the image.

* RP `pixelrel` - The optical center is measured in pixel coordinates relative to the center of the image.

* AP `pixelabs` - The optical center is measured in absolute pixel coordinates from the bottom-left corner of the image.

Focal Lengths `focallength` - ⊞ - The focal length components of the camera matrix descibed either as normalized resolution-independent values or as pixels. The focal length acts as a scalar on the other distortion parameters. The normalized unit mode can be used for systems that use millimeters or other physical units. Often abbreviated as Fx and Fy. See [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/master/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html) for details.

* Focal Lengths `focallength1` -

* Focal Lengths `focallength2` -

Focal Length Units `focallengthunit` - ⊞ -

* F `fraction` - The focal length is described in fractional or normalized coordinates.

* P `pixels` - The focal length is described in pixels.

Layout `layout` - ⊞ - Determines how the transformed image is arranged inside the final output image space. This value can be useful to preserve the native pixel resolution of the input image, or ensuring a final output resolution and aspect ratio.

* Scale to Fit `scale` - The transformed image is scaled to fill the full resolution and aspect ratio of the output image. This mode is useful if you want a specific output resolution or aspect ratio.

* Native Resolution `native` - The transformed image is arranged in the output in a way that preserves its original resolution and aspect ratio. This may mean the image is cropped if the output resolution is smaller than the input resolution.

Extend Mode `extendmode` - ⊞ - Determines what values are used when the output image exceeds the bounds of the input image.

* Hold `hold` - Colors from the outside edge of the input image are extended to fill any gaps in the output image.

* Zero `zero` - Empty gaps in the output image are filled with zeroes in all channels.

* Repeat `repeat` - The input image is tiled to fill gaps in the output image.

* Mirror `mirror` - The input image is mirrored and tiled to fill games in the output image.

Optimal Alpha `alpha` - Determines how much of the image is preserved when calculating the optimal post transform. When zero, the optimal transform will include only the region of interest. When one, the transform will include all of the pixels from the input image. This value is equivalent to the 'alpha' value used in OpenCVs getOptimalNewCameraMatrix function.
Post Transform `transformmode` - ⊞ - Choose whether to preform an addition transformation to the image after the lens distortion is applied. This is useful for positioning and scaling the distorted image within the final image frame and can be used to preserve parts of the input image that would be shifted out of frame by the distortion.

* None `none` - No additional transformation is applied.

* Optimal `optimal` - The image is transformed according to the optimal new camera matrix as given by OpenCVs getOptimalNewCamera matrix. Depending on the value of the Optimal Alpha parameter, this mode can be used to ensure that none of the input image is lost outside of the image frame.

* Custom `custom` - Enables the custom center and scaling parameters. Use this option to modify the output image relative to the camera matrix on the Lens Distort page.

* New Camera Matrix `newmatrix` - Enter a new camera matrix for positioning the output image within the frame. Entering the camera matrix values from the Lens Distort page will result in no further transformation. Entering the optimal new camera matrix values will produce the same results as using the Optimal transform mode.

New Center `newcenter` - ⊞ - A new optical center position that allows for shifting the transformed image within the output image frame. Using the same value as the Optical Center parameter will result in no post distortion offset. Using the Optimal Center value will produce the same results as the Optimal transform mode.

* New Center `newcenter1` -

* New Center `newcenter2` -

New Center Unit `newcenterunit` - ⊞ - Determines how the new center values are interpreted.

* R `relative` - The center is measured in normalized coordinates from -0.5 to -0.5 relative to the center of the image.

* A `absolute` - The center is measured in normalized coordinates (0 to 1) from the bottom-left corner of the image.

* RP `pixelrel` - The center is measured in pixel coordinates relative to the center of the image.

* AP `pixelabs` - The center is measured in absolute pixel coordinates from the bottom-left corner of the image.

New Focal Lengths `newfocallength` - ⊞ - A new focal length that allows for scaling the transformed image relative to output image frame. Using the same value as the Focal Lengths parameter will result in no post distortion scaling. Using the Optimal Focal Length value will produce the same results as the Optimal transform mode.

* New Focal Lengths `newfocallength1` -

* New Focal Lengths `newfocallength2` -

New Focal Length Units `newfocallengthunit` - ⊞ -

Center Offset `centeroffset` - ⊞ - Shifts the distorted image within the output image frame.

* Center Offset `centeroffset1` -

* Center Offset `centeroffset2` -

Center Offset Unit `centeroffsetunit` - ⊞ -

* F `fraction` - The offset amount is measured as a fraction of the output image from -0.5 to 0.5.

* P `pixels` - The offset amount is measured in pixels of the input image.

Scale `scale` - ⊞ - Performs an additional post-distortion scale on the image. The scale is relative to the original camera matrix, so values greater than 1 will stretch the image, while values less than 1 will shrink it.

* Scale `scale1` -

* Scale `scale2` -

Cropping `cropmode` - ⊞ - Crop the transformed image so that only part of the image will appear in the final output. Unless a custom resolution is given, the cropped region will be used to determine the final output resolution.

* None `none` - No cropping is done.

* Region of Interest `roi` - The region of interest (ROI), as defined by the OpenCV function getNewCameraMatrix, is used to crop the final output. The ROI is automatically updated by any post transform functions, so this mode will still work when using a custom transform; however, cropping the ROI from a transformed image will generally produce the same result as using no transform or crop.

* Custom `custom` - Enter custom cropping region in pixels or as a fraction of the frame. Entering the ROI values from an attached Info CHOP will produce the same results as using the Region of Interest cropping mode.

Custom Region `cropregion` - ⊞ - Defines a custom cropping region in the order of Left, Bottom, Right, Top. The values can either be as a fraction of the image (0-1) or as pixels of the input image size. Entering the ROI values from an attached Info CHOP will produce the same results as using the Region of Interest cropping mode.

* Custom Region `cropregionx` - The left side of the cropping region.

* Custom Region `cropregiony` - The bottom side of the cropping region.

* Custom Region `cropregionz` - The right side of the cropping region.

* Custom Region `cropregionw` - The top side of the cropping region.

Crop Unit `cropunit` - ⊞ - The units used to interpret the values of the custom cropping region. Can be as fractions (0-1) of the image or as pixels of the input image size.

* F `fraction` -

* P `pixels` -

Scale Unit `scaleunit` - ⊞ - Determines how the scale values are used.

* F `fraction` - The scale is described in fractional or normalized coordinates.

* P `pixels` - The scale is described in pixels.

Level TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Level TOP

The Level TOP adjusts image contrast, brightness, gamma, black level, color range, quantization, opacity and more. See also the [Luma Level TOP](Luma_Level_TOP.html "Luma Level TOP") which preserves hue and saturation more accurately, but is slower.

The Level TOP's features have been built into one TOP to maximize performance in a single pass. It takes all its parameters to make a lookup table on the CPU, so animating parameters in the Level TOP will decrease its performance as the lookup table is recreated each frame that a parameter changes.

Clamp Input `clampinput` - ⊞ - This option will clamp pixel values in between 0 and 1. When using higher bit depth floating pixel formats, it is recommended to set it to Unclamped to allow the full range of values to be operated on. Auto should detect the pixel format as set accordingly.

* Automatic `automatic` - Detects pixel format and clamps if 8-bit fixed or leaves unclamped for floating point pixel formats.

* Clamp [0-1] `clamp` - Clamps data to values between 0 and 1. Recommended for 8-bit fixed default pixel format for better performance.

* Unclamped `unclamped` - No clamping of data, use for higher bit-depth pixel formats.

Invert `invert` - Inverts the colors in the image. Black becomes white, white becomes black. Colors invert across the color wheel, so red becomes cyan, blue becomes yellow, green becomes magenta, and so on.
Black Level `blacklevel` - Any pixel with a value less than or equal to this will be black.
Brightness 1 `brightness1` - Increases or decreases the brightness of an image. Brightness can be considered the arithmetic mean of the RGB channels. The Brightness parameter adds or subtracts an offset into the R, G, and B channels. Low brightness will result in dark tones, while high brightness will wash the color out towards white.
Gamma 1 `gamma1` - The Gamma parameter applies a gamma correction to the image. Gamma is the relationship between the brightness of a pixel as it appears on the screen, and the numerical value of that pixel. This is often represented by a gamma curve. The difference between brightness and gamma is that gamma also affects the ratio of red to green to blue. A straight, linear gamma curve with a value of 1 means no change.
Contrast `contrast` - Contrast applies a scale factor (gain) to the RGB channels. Increasing contrast will brighten the light areas and darken the dark areas of the image, making the difference between the light and dark areas of the image stronger.

In Low `inlow` - Any pixel below this value appears black.
In High `inhigh` - Any pixel above this value appears white.
Out Low `outlow` - Clamps pixel values to this value or higher.
Out High `outhigh` - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.

## Parameters - RGBA Page

Low R `lowr` - Clamps the minimum level of the red channel.
High R `highr` - Clamps the maximum level of the red channel.
Low G `lowg` - Clamps the minimum level of the green channel.
High G `highg` - Clamps the maximum level of the green channel.
Low B `lowb` - Clamps the minimum level of the blue channel.
High B `highb` - Clamps the maximum level of the blue channel.
Low A `lowa` - Clamps the minimum level of the alpha channel.
High A `higha` - Clamps the maximum level of the alpha channel.

## Parameters - Step Page

Apply Stepping `stepping` - Turns on stepping (posterizing) and enables the parameters below.
Step Size `stepsize` - Posterizes the image into bands or stripes. Number of bands equal to the inverse of this parameter (i.e., 0.25 = 4 bands). Use a default Ramp TOP to easily see this parameter's effect.
Threshold `threshold` - Offsets the position of the step boundaries.
Clamp Low `clamplow` - Clamps the image's minimum value. (*value* as in hue, saturation, and *value*)
Clamp High `clamphigh` - Clamps the image's maximum value. (*value* as in hue, saturation, and *value*)
Soften `soften` - Softens or blends the boundaries between steps.

Gamma 2 `gamma2` - A second gamma correction that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.
Opacity `opacity` - Adjust the opacity, or transparency, of the image.
Brightness 2 `brightness2` - A second brightness adjustment that is added after the Range, RGBA, and Step page adjustments have been applied.
Clamp `clamp` - Clamps pixel values to this value or lower.
Clamp Low `clamplow2` - Clamps the image's minimum value. (*value* as in hue, saturation, and *value*)
Clamp High `clamphigh2` - Clamps the image's maximum value. (*value* as in hue, saturation, and *value*)
Pre-Multiply RGB by Alpha `premultrgbbyalpha` - This option makes the color channels pre-multiplied by alpha.

# LFO CHOP

The LFO CHOP (low frequency oscillator) generates waves in real-time in two ways. It synthesizes curves using a choice of common waveforms like Sine or Pulse, or it repeats a prepared incoming curve.

It steps through the waveform at a rate that depends on the Frequency parameter and the Octave Control input. To watch its behavior, attach a Trail CHOP to its output and alter the Frequency parameter.

Up to three input CHOPs can be connected to the LFO CHOP:

**Octave Control** - Without this first (optional) input, the frequency is simply the Frequency parameter. If this input is connected, every unit doubles the frequency: When Octave Control is 1, the frequency is double, when it is 2 it is 4x, when it is -1 the frequency is half the Frequency parameter and when it is 0, there is no change in the frequency.

**Reset** - The seond (optional) input contains on-off (<=0 or >0) that restarts the channels of the oscillator from the beginning of the wave. The reset depends on the setting of the Reset Condition menu. By default, when the Reset input goes from off to on, it resets the wave and starts the waveform immediately. If Reset Condition is set to "While On", the reset value will be held until the Reset input goes off. Reset means "stop the oscillator and cue it at the start of the waveform".

**Source Wave** - The third (optional) input is a replacement of the waveform Type. It is a multi-sample CHOP curve and can contain any number of channels, limited to the channels defined on the Channel page. The waveform Type parameter is disabled.

The LFO CHOP can serve as a general motion time-warper and repeater. If you alter the Frequency, you can control the time warp.

Unlike the [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP"), this is a time-sliced CHOP, that is, it generates its waveform as it goes, and speeds/slows how it steps through the waveform Type while the Frequency changes. Unlike the [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP"), the LFO CHOP is designed for non-audio frequencies.

See also: [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP"), [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP"), [Pulse CHOP](Pulse_CHOP.html "Pulse CHOP").

Light COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Light COMP

The Light Components are objects which cast light into a 3D scene. With the light parameters you can control the color, brightness, and atmosphere of geometry lit by the light. A scene can also be viewed through a light's perspective, similar to a [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP").

**Tip**: To avoid a light from consuming compute time when it's off, make the Dimmer parameter less than .001.

See [Geometry Viewer](Geometry_Viewer.html "Geometry Viewer") to learn about how you can inspect from a light.

## Parameters - Shadows Page

Enabling shadows will cause this node to render the scene in a depth-only pass to create a shadow map. This map will then be used by [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") when rendering to create shadows for objects lit by this light.

Aspect Correct Projection `aspectcorrect` - Keeps the aspect ratio of the view correct when using the light as a camera to look through.
Ortho Width `orthowidth` - Only active if Orthographic is chosen from the Projection pop-up menu. This specifies the width of the orthographic projection.
Use Cone Angle/Delta for FOV `useconeforfov` - If the light is set to Cone Light type, enabling this option sets the FOV using the Cone Angle and Cone Delta parameters on the Light parameter page.
Viewing Angle Method `viewanglemethod` - ⊞ - This menu determines which method is used to define the camera's angle of view.

FOV Angle `fov` - The field of view (FOV) angle is the angular extend of the scene imaged by the camera.
Focal Length `focal` - The parameter sets the focal length of the lens, zooming in and out. Perspective is flattened or exaggerated depending on focal length. Some interesting distortion effects can be acheived with this parameter.
Aperture `aperture` - This value relates to the area through which light can pass for the camera.
Near `near` - This control allows you to designate the near clipping planes. Geometry closer to the lens than these distances will not be visible.
Far `far` - This control allows you to designate the far clipping planes. Geometry further away from the lens than these distances will not be visible.
Proj Matrix/CHOP/DAT `projmatrixop` - When Custom Projection Matrix is selected, this parameters should be filled in with either a CHOP or a DAT with a custom 4x4 projection matrix. If a CHOP is used the first sample of the first 16 channels of the CHOP are used to create a 4x4 matrix. The channels can be thought as being read row-by-row or column-by-column. If a DAT is given a 4x4 table should be used. The matrix convention used is column major, which means vectors/points are multiplied on the right of the matrix.
Custom Projection GLSL DAT `customproj` - Takes a DAT containing a GLSL shader to specify custom projection functions. You must provide two functions in this shader. Both functions must be provided and return correct results for your rendering to work in all cases. As a starting point, here are the definitions for these functions that are used when custom ones are not provided.
```
  vec4 TDSOPToProj(vec4 p)				
  {				
      vec4 projP = uTDMat.worldCamProj * p;				
      return projP;				
  }			
  vec4 TDCamToProj(vec4 p)				
  {				
      vec4 projP = uTDMat.proj * p;				
      return projP;				
  }

The other convenience variations of these functions such as `vec3 TDCamToProj(vec3 p)` will automatically call the correct one of either of the two above functions. You can use uniforms/samplers in this shader code by declaring them here and providing them in the GLSL page of the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP").

Background Color `bgcolor` - ⊞ - Set the background color of the view when using the light as a camera.

Extra Information for the Light COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and Light COMP are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

Limit CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Limit CHOP

The Limit CHOP can limit the values of the input channels to be between a minimum and maximum, and can quantize the input channels in time and/or value such that the value steps over time.

Limiting a channel causes all its values to lie within a range. Several different methods are for limiting are listed under the Type parameter description.

Quantizing a channel value snaps its values to the closest allowable value (the "quantized values"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.

Quantizing a channel index is like quantizing in time, and acts as a sample and hold mechanism. The channel is sampled at a quantized index, and held at that value until the next quantized index at which time the value takes on the input value at that point.

Limit TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Limit TOP

The Limit TOP can limit the pixel values of the input image to fall between a minimum and maximum value, and can quantize the pixels by value or position.

Limiting a channel causes all of its values to lie within the given range. Several different methods are available to determine what happens to values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range.

Quantizing pixel values will snap each channel to the closest allowable value (the "quantized values"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.

Quantizing pixel positions will cause all pixels within the quantization step to take the same value. This is equivalent to lowering the image resolution and then scaling the image back to its original size with no filtering applied.

Minimum Function `minop` - ⊞ - The wrapping method used when applying limits to the pixel values in the image.

* Off `off` - No limits are applied to the pixel values.

* Clamp `clamp` - Pixel values are constrained to the ranged defined by the Minimum and Maximum parameters. Values outside of the range are replaced with the Minimum or Maximum value.

* Loop `loop` - Values outside of the Minimum/Maximum range continue at the other end of the interval e.g. as values go above the Maximum they loop back and start again at the Minimum value.

* Zig Zag `zigzag` - When values go beyond the Minimum or Maximum values they mirror back towards the other end of the range e.g. when a value goes above the maximum it flips and starts going back to the minimum.

Maximum Function `maxop` - ⊞ - The wrapping method used when applying limits to the pixel values in the image.

Minimum Value `min` - The minimum value that any of the channels in the output image can have.
Maximum Value `max` - The maximum value that any of the channels in the output image can have.
Positive Only `positive` - Apply an absolute value function after all other limits and quantizations are calculated e.g. all negatives are made positive.
Normalize `norm` - Normalize values in the output image so that they are all scaled and shifted to fall between the Normalized Minimum and Maximum (0 to 1 by default). This operation requires multiple internal render passes and is slightly slower than other limit operations. Normalization is done after all other limits and quantizations are applied.
Normalize Minimum `normmin` - The minimum value for pixels after normalization.
Normalize Maximum `normmax` - The maximum value for pixels after normalization.

Quantize Value `quantvalue` - ⊞ - The function used to quantize the pixel values in the output image.

* Off `off` - Pixel values are not quantized.

* Ceiling `ceiling` - Pixel values are rounded up to the nearest quantization step.

* Floor `floor` - Pixel values are rounded down to the nearest quantization step.

* Round `round` - Pixel values are rounded to the nearest quantization step.

Value Step `vstep` - The quantization step size for pixel values.
Value Offset `voffset` - An offset for the quantization step so that it doesn't have to lie on zero.
Quantize Position `quantpos` - ⊞ - The function used for spacial quantization e.g. quantizing the UV coordinates so that pixel values are merged into larger blocks.

* Off `off` - Position (spacial) quantization is not used.

* Ceiling `ceiling` - Pixels are rounded up to the nearest spacial quantization step (towards the top-right).

* Floor `floor` - Pixels are rounded down to the nearest spacial quantization step (towards the bottom-left).

* Round `round` - Pixels are rounded towards the nearest quantization step.

Position Step `posstep` - The size of the spacial quantization step in UV space (0-1)

Line MAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Line MAT

The Line MAT renders 3D line segments, dots and vectors. The line width and color can be varied based on distance to the camera, using two models: a 1/z dropoff (z = distance from camera), or a near-far distance rolloff model, where you set the width and color at the near and far distances, and you vary three rolloff controls.

For lines it renders different types of end caps and hinge/joints (round, box, arrow).
The light model is flat-shaded (no affect from scene lighting). It draws edges (like polygon edges), points and vectors from points. There are different parameters to control the desired shape, as explained in the Parameter sections.
It renders several primitive types: polygons, meshes, NURBS, quads, etc. It also manages closed polygons / open polygons.

You can render a dot at each point. You can render a vector at each point which uses any attribute, like Normal (N). The points or vectors can have their own colors and alpha.

Line Width is a resolution-independent quantity. A line width of 1 will draw a line that is 1/1000 the width of the image. This is true when used with orthographic cameras and perspective cameras.

To make the width of a line and its points vary per-point of a SOP, the width can be set by adding a point attribute `width` on the SOP being rendered. A value of 2 scales the width at that point by 2 times its normal width. New point attributes can be created with the [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP") Custom page. To affect per-point width and not affect the line width, use the point attribute `pscale`.

When you are animating Ortho Width or Field of View, you may want line widths to adjust more realistically. When the parameter "Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width" is on, the behavior is different: For Ortho cameras, the drawn line width increases when Ortho Width drops below 1, (as if you are zooming into it), and decreases when Ortho Width increases above 1. For Perspective cameras, the drawn line width increases when Field of View drops below 90 degrees, and decreases when Field of View increases above 90 degrees. Note that when the parameter "Width Affected by FOV/Ortho Width" is on, lines are still resolution-independent.

This is a general setup page for globally control the shared features of Lines, Points, and Vectors. Every change in this page will affect all the three mentioned types.

Depth Interpolation Model `depthinterpolationmodel` - ⊞ - Depth Interpolation Model depthmodel – a menu to select how the width of line items changes by their distance from the camera.

* S Curve `scurve` - a bounded range for the width between the near and far planes (Distance Near and Far) that uses S Curve for a more dramatic and yet smooth (referring to the continuity of the curve) changes. The curve shape can be controlled by Bias, Steepness, and Linearize parameters.

* Inverse Distance `inversedistance` - uses the inverse distance weighting which provides a more visually accurate changes on the final width.

Inverse Distance Exponent `inversedistanceexponent` - When the Depth Interpolation Model is Inverse Distance, this determines how fast the widths/sizes decrease with distance. If it is set to 1 (default), the width goes down at the rate of 1/r. If it set to 2, it goes down by 1/(r\*r), meaning that for lines/dots at a distance r that have a width of w, that line/dot at a distance twice as far away (2r) are 1/4 the width/size as they are at distance r.
Distance Near `distancenear` - Specifies a near plane with a certain distance from the camera.
Distance Far `distancefar` - Specifies a far plane with a certain distance from the camera.
Width Near `widthnear` - Specifies a fixed width value when the distance from camera is less than or equal to Distance Near. See the Summary of this operator for an explantion of the treatment of line width.
Width Far `widthfar` - Specifies a fixed width value when the distance from the camera is equal or bigger than the Distance Far. Note when the Near-Far Range option is selected as the Depth Model, any point in between Distance Near and Distance Far will be calculated based on sine curve.
Width Affected by FOV/OrthoWidth `widthaffectedbyfov` - With this off (default), looking at a rendered image of a certain resolution, a line of with w will always be the same # of pixels wide as you change the field-of-view or ortho width. With this parameter on, a line of width w will be half the number of pixels wide if you double the field-of-view or double the ortho width. Relevant if you are animating camera zoom, for instance.
Width Bias `widthbias` - Moves the S Curve’s bias backward or forward for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model).
Width Steepness `widthsteepness` - Controls the steepness of the S Curve for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model). The higher the value of the steepness, you will notice more dramatic changes (higher slope) in the curve width. Also, with lower values of steepness, the curve transforms into a more linear form.
Width Linearize `widthlinearize` - Control the amount of curvature in the curve for width interpolation (only S Curve depth model).
Color Bias `colorbias` - Moves the S Curve’s bias backward or forward for color interpolation.
Color Steepness `colorsteepness` - Controls the steepness of the S Curve for color interpolation.
Color Linearize `colorlinearize` - Control the amount of curvature in the curve for color interpolation.
Lift Direction `liftdirection` - ⊞ - If a line is being drawn on a polygon or its edge (the polygon being in another Geometry COMP + shader), and you need to lift it off the surface to be fully visible, this specifies whether to displace the line points toward the camera or along the line's normal (which can be the direction of the polygon's normal).

* Along Camera Z Axis `alongcamerazaxis` - displace the points along Camera Z axis.

* Along Normal `alongnormal` - displace the points along point's Normal vector.

* Toward Camera `towardcamera` -

Lift Scale `liftscale` - For lines that are drawn on top of filled polygons or along their edges, they may be cut off because they are rendered in the same place. To make it look good, you want to lift the line toward the camera or along its normal away from the surface. This parameter scales how far you lift the line off the surface to make it look good without separating them too far.
Num Points in Circle `numptsincircle` - When drawing Points in Circle (Polygon) mode, or drawing end-caps, or elbows between edges, this determines how many points you would draw in a full-circle arc to simulate a circular shape. The lower the number, the faster it renders.

## Callbacks

Every cell, row, column and table in a List component is described by [attributes](ListAttribute_Class.html "ListAttribute Class") which are specified through the initialize and callback functions of the List component.
For usage please refer to the [![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html) [listCOMP\_Class](ListCOMP_Class.html "ListCOMP Class") page.

## Drag/Drop

The listCOMP uses [Drag/Drop Callbacks](Drag-and-Drop.html#Drag.2FDrop_Callbacks "Drag-and-Drop") to implement dragging and dropping behavior. The provided `info` dictionary in those callbacks will include a `listCell` member describing what cell is being dragged or dropped on. A ListCell can also be in the `dragItems` list.

ListCell objects contain the following members:

`owner` - the listCOMP operator containing the list cell
`row` - row of the cell
`col` - col of the cell

To create a ListCell object, use this function: `ListCell(owner, row, col)`

## Parameters - List Page

Callbacks `callbacks` - A reference to the callback DAT.
Rows `rows` - The number of rows in the List.
Columns `cols` - The number of columns in the List.
Lock First Row `lockfirstrow` - Locks the first row in place when scrolling horizontally.
Lock First Col `lockfirstcol` - Locks the first column in place when scrolling vertically.
Horizontal Scroll Bar `hscrollbar` - Enables the horizontal scroll bar.
Vertical Scroll Bar `vscrollbar` - Enables the vertical scroll bar.
Off Cell Callbacks `offcellcallbacks` - When on, you get callbacks (select, rollover, etc) on List COMP areas that are not in any cells. For example, the area below a list when the list has a large size but only a few entries at the top.
Reset `reset` - Resets the table by running its initialize callbacks.

# ListAttributes Class

The ListAttributes class describes a set of [list attribute objects](ListAttribute_Class.html "ListAttribute Class") for cells, rows, columns or table. It can be accessed from a [List Component](ListCOMP_Class.html "ListCOMP Class").

Access to individual List Attributes depends on what type: row, col, or cell:

```
rowAttribs = op('list1').rowAttribs		# get the ListAttributes object for rows
print(len(rowAttribs))					# number of rows 
print(rowAttribs[0].bgColor)			# rows are accessed by row #. 
										# This prints the background color settings for the first row

colAttribs = op('list1').colAttribs		# get the ListAttributes object for columns
print(len(colAttribs))					# number of columns 
print(colAttribs[0].bgColor)			# cols are accessed by column #. 
										# This prints the background color settings for the first column

cellAttribs = op('list1').cellAttribs	# get the ListAttributes object for columns
print(len(cellAttribs))					# total number of cells 
print(colAttribs[0,2].bgColor)			# cells are accessed by [row, col]. 
										# This prints the background color settings for the cell in the first row, third column

**Note:** The attributes above are the settings for List Component's hierarchical layout technique. This means that cell settings
override row settings, which override column settings, which override table settings. If you want to know the final value in a
given cell, use `listCOMP.displayAttribs[row, col]`.

# LOD SOP

The LOD SOP is unusual in so far as it does not actually alter any geometry. Instead it builds a level of detail cache for the input object. The cache to be drawn is based upon the distance to the camera. Thus, a complicated object will be drawn with a lower level of detail when it is farther away.

The second input is the **Rest Geometry**. If provided, this is the geometry wich will be used to do the (expensive) polygon reduction, and only the points of the left input will be used.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[lodSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/LodSOP_Class "LodSOP Class")

Step % `steppercent` - Each successive level of detail will contain approximately this percentage on the number of polygons in the higher level of detail.
Dist. Threshhold `distance` - This is the distance from the camera at which full detail will be present.
Minimum % `minpercent` - The objects won't be drawn with fewer than this number of polygons.
Stiffen Border `borderweight` - The amount of weight to avoid erosion of boundary polygons.
Equalize Edges `lengthweight` - The amount of weight to favour even sized polygons.
Pre-Triangulate `triangulate` - Polygons can only be reduced if they are triangles. This option thus first converts them.
Optimize Rendering `tstrips` - When set, triangle strips will be generated and used for drawing.
Only Affect Polygons `polysonly` - If this is enabled, only the polygonal portion of the model will be displayed at lower levels of detail. Otherwise, all types of surfaces are affected by the distance to the camera.

Extra Information for the LOD SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Rendering is the creation of a 3D image with the Render TOP. Rendering is also used more generally to include the compositing (with TOPs) to generate an output image.

Logic CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Logic CHOP

The Logic CHOP first converts channels of all its input CHOPs into binary (0 = off, 1 = on) channels and then combines the channels using a variety of logic operations.

**NOTE:** The Logic CHOP is superceded by more convenient operators like the [CHOP Execute DAT](CHOP_Execute_DAT.html "CHOP Execute DAT") or the [Text DAT](Text_DAT.html "Text DAT") which will run their scripts when CHOP channels change.

The Logic CHOP performs logic operations on the samples in CHOP channels. The channels of a CHOP can be combined into one channel, and several CHOPs can be combined into one CHOP.

With one input CHOP, you can invert the values of each sample. You can also do logic operations on the samples of one channel by the samples in the other channels, reducing N channels down to one. You can combine by applying an "or", "and", etc..

With two or more CHOP inputs, you can combine the channels in one CHOP with the channels in all the other CHOPs, reducing N CHOPs to 1.

To do math operations (add, multiply, ...) between channels or CHOPs, use the [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP").

## Parameters - Logic Page

Convert Input `convert` - ⊞ - This menu determines the method to convert inputs to binary:

* Off When Zero `nonzero` - Returns a logical 0 when channel value is zero;  
   Non zero values return 1.

* Off When Zero Or Less `pos` - Returns a logical 0 when a channel value is zero or less; and 1 when values are positive.

* And `and` - On if all inputs are on, otherwise off.

* Or `or` - On if at least one input is on, otherwise off.

* Exclusive Or `xor` - On if one input on, but not more than one.

Lookup CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Lookup CHOP

The Lookup CHOP outputs values from a lookup table. The first input (the Index Channel) is an index into the second input (the Lookup Table). Lookup outputs interpolated values from the lookup table.

Both the Index and Lookup Tables can contain any number of channels.

An Index sample with value 0 maps to the beginning (first sample) of the lookup table, and an index sample with value of 1 maps to the end (last sample) of the lookup table.

The output CHOP is the same length as the Index input. It is the same number of channels as the Lookup Table input, and has the same channel names as the Lookup Table input. The output is filled with the data extracted from the lookup tables. Indexes that fall between two lookup table samples are interpolated. The lookup table can be sampled outside its range.

NOTE: The Extend Conditions of the lookup table are used in this case where the index is less than 0 or greater than 1.

The sample rate of the output is the sample rate of the Index input.

The Lookup CHOP can be used to fetch values from a color lookup table, where a single index produces red, green and blue channels. It can also be used for rolloff or decay tables, where it specifies how much a parameter drops with distance.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[lookupCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/LookupCHOP_Class "LookupCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Lookup Page

Index Range `index` - ⊞ - The Index Range maps the index channel's values to the lookup table's start and end and defaults to 0 and 1. The first parameter represents the start of the lookup table. When the index channel has this value, it will index the start of the lookup table. The second parameter represents the end of the lookup table and behaves in the same way.

* `index1` -

* `index2` -

Cyclic Range `cyclic` - ⊞ - Adapts the range of the Lookup Table (2nd input) for cyclic or non-cyclic input indices. When using a cyclic input index (1st input), the lookup value for index 0.0 and 1.0 result in the same value. To avoid this, set Cyclic Range to Yes and the lookup will cycle smoothly.

* Yes `yes` - For looking up a cyclic output (oscillator, beat driven output etc).

* No `no` - For looking up a single wave (slider mapping, etc).

Per Index Channel `chanmatch` - ⊞ - Determines how index channels are mapped to lookup Channel tables.

* One Lookup Table Channel `onetoone` - The first index channel is matched to the full lookup table.

* All Lookup Table Channels `onetomany` - Each index channel is matched with every lookup table.

Match by `match` - ⊞ - Determines how index channels are matched with a lookup channel in 'One Lookup Table Channel' mode.

* Channel Number `index` - An index channel is matched to a lookup table by its index within the clip. Lookup tables are cycled if there are few of them than index channels.

* Channel Name `name` - An index channel is matched to a lookup table by name. Unmatched index channels are left "as is".

Interpolate `interp` - When on, the input can be interpolated between samples. When off, the nearest sample is used.
Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before/after range) for the lookup output.

Extend Right `right` - ⊞ - The right extend conditions (before/after range) for the lookup output.

Extra Information for the Lookup CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Lookup DAT

The Lookup DAT outputs values from a lookup Table. The first input is an index into the second input.

The Lookup DAT allows you to select rows from its second input by referencing data either via row/column indices or row/column names. The advantage of the Lookup DAT is such that the order the data is selected is independent from the order in the Lookup Table, rather the Index Table dictates the order therefore allowing for reordering of data and selecting rows/columns multiple times.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[lookupDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/LookupDAT_Class "LookupDAT Class")

Index `index` - ⊞ - Select how the index values are interpreted: as values/indices contained in a column or contained in a row.

* Row Indices `rowindices` - Rows selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as numerical indices in the Index input.

* Col Indices `colindices` - Columns selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as numerical indices in the Index input.

* Row Values `rowvalues` - Rows selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as values in the Index input. By default the first column is used to match the index but this can changed by setting the Value Location as well as Name or Index Parameter.

* Col Values `colvalues` - Columns selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as values in the Index input. By default the first row is used to match the index but this can changed by setting the Value Location as well as Name or Index Parameter.

Value Location `valueloction` - ⊞ - When 'Row Values' or 'Col Values' is selected in the Index Parameter, this parameter lets you select how the lookup row or column where the index value searches will be specified.

* Name `name` - The lookup row or column is specified by name.

* Index `index` - The lookup row or column is specified by index.

Value Name `valuename` - Specify the name of the lookup row or column.

# Lookup TOP

The Lookup TOP replaces color values in the TOP image connected to its first input with values derived from a lookup table created from its second input or a lookup table created using the CHOP parameter. When using the 2nd input, the lookup table is created by defining a line (start and end position) on the TOP image. When using a CHOP the lookup table is created directly from the CHOP's values and the 2nd input is ignored.

The Index Range parameter can be used to define the minimum and maximum index values that will map to the first and last values in the lookup table. When the index goes outside of this range, it will **hold** on the first or last value of the lookup table.

  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Method `method` - ⊞ - Choose to use a line from the 2nd input (defined using UV coordinates) or CHOP values to define the lookup table.

* 2nd Input, UV Coordinates `secondinput` - Use the Dark UV and Light UV parameters to define the lookup table as a line extrated from the 2nd input.

* CHOP Values `chop` - Use a CHOP referenced in th CHOP parameter to define the lookup table.

Index Range `index` - ⊞ - The Index Range maps the index values to the lookup table's start and end and defaults to 0 and 1. The first parameter represents the start of the lookup table. When the index color has this value, it will index the start of the lookup table. The second parameter represents the end of the lookup table and behaves in the same way. **Note:** When the index goes outside of this range, it will **hold** on the first or last value of the lookup table.

* `index1` - The minimum index value that maps to the start of the lookup table. Indices below this value will hold on the first value of the lookup table.

* `index2` - The maximum index value that maps to the end of the lookup table. Indices above this value will hold on the last value of the lookup table.

* Index Range `index1` -

* Index Range `index2` -

Index Channel `channel` - ⊞ - The Index Channel controls how the color from the input is turned into a index to do the lookup. By default, the RGBA Independent option will do a separate lookup in each channel i.e. the red output channel will be based on the red value in the lookup table and the red value in the index image. For other options, like Luminance or RGBA Average, a single index value is calculated from the index color and all channels of the output image will be taken from the same pixel of the lookup table at the given index.

* RGBA Independent `independent` -

Independent Alpha `independentalpha` - When enabled, the Alpha value of the output image is retrieved independently from the lookup table based on the alpha channel of the index image (the first input). This option can reproduce the legacy behavior of using the luminance to lookup the RGB values while using the alpha to separately lookup the alpha value. This option has no effect if using the 'RGBA Independent' or 'Alpha' index channel options since those modes already use the alpha channel as an index.
Dark UV `darkuv` - ⊞ - Set the UV position to use for dark end of the lookup table. In the original image connected to the first input, any pixel with a value of (0,0,0) will be replaced by the value found at this UV position in the image connected to the second input.

* `darkuv1` -

* `darkuv2` -

Dark UV Unit `darkuvunit` - ⊞ -

* A `fractionaspect` -

Light UV `lightuv` - ⊞ - Set the UV position to use for light end of the lookup table. In the original image connected to the first input, any pixel with a value of (1,1,1) will be replaced by the value found at this UV position in the image connected to the second input.

* `lightuv1` -

* `lightuv2` -

Light UV Unit `lightuvunit` - ⊞ -

CHOP `chop` - Reference the CHOP to use to define the RGBA (A is optional) values in the lookup table.
Clamp CHOP Values `clampchopvalues` - Clamps CHOP values between 0-1.
Output Lookup `displaylookup` - Outputs the lookup table itself, instead of replacing the color values of the first input.

# LSystem SOP

The Lsystem SOP implements L-systems (Lindenmayer-systems, named after Aristid Lindenmayer (1925-1989)), allow definition of complex shapes through the use of iteration. They use a mathematical language in which an initial string of characters is evaluated repeatedly, and the results are used to generate geometry. The result of each evaluation becomes the basis for the next iteration of geometry, giving the illusion of growth.

You begin building an L-system by defining a sequence of rules which are evaluated to produce a new string of characters. Each character of the new string represents one command which affects an imaginary stylus, or "turtle". Repeating this process will grow your geometry.

You can use L-systems to create things such as:

* Create organic objects such as trees, plants, flowers over time.
* Create animated branching objects such as lightning and snowflakes.

### The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants

The descriptions located here should be enough to get you started in writing your own L-system rules, however, if you have any serious interests in creating L-systems, you should obtain the book:

## Parameters - Geometry Page

Type `type` - ⊞ - Provides two options for output geometry:

* Skeleton `skel` - Creates wire frame geometry. This option is ideal for geometry that is stiff and jagged like lightning or snowflakes. It is also useful to reduce SOP cooking time.

* Tube `tube` - Creates tube geometry. This option can be used with solid geometry that would need smooth curves, like trees or shrubs. Parameters on the [Tube Page](#Parameters_-_Tube_Page) are only enabled when this Type is selected.

Generations `generations` - Determines the number of times to apply the rules to the initial string. This value controls the growth of the L-system. Place a time-based function here to animate the L-system growth.
Random Scale `randscale` - Random Scale as a percentage. This will apply a random scale to the changing geometry's lengths, angles and thickness.
Random Seed `randseed` - Random Seed for the SOP. This value can be used to select different sequences of random values.
Continuous Angles `contangl` - Calculates the incremental angles of branches, if a non-integer generational value is used. If the Generations field is animating, this should be set to ensure smooth growth.
Continuous Length `contlength` - Calculates the incremental lengths of the geometry points if a non-integer generational value is used. As with Continuous Angles, if the Generations field is animating, this should be set to ensure smooth, continuous growth. The Continuous Width field applies to tube thickness.
Continuous Width `contwidth` - Calculates the incremental lengths of the geometry points if a non-integer generational value is used. As with Continuous Angles, if the Generations field is animating, this should be set to ensure smooth, continuous growth. The Continuous Width field applies to tube thickness.
Apply Color `docolor` - Use a TOP to apply color to the L-system as it grows.
Image File `colormap` - Defines a TOP to use when the Apply Color button is selected. Also see the ` and # turtle operators.
UV Increment `inc` - ⊞ - Defines the default color U, V index increments when the turtle symbols ` or # are used.

* `incu` -

* `incv` -

Point Width Attribute `pointwidth` - Adds a point `width` attribute to each point in the geometry. This width is effected by the Thickness and Thickness Scale parameters on the Tube Page.

## Parameters - Tube Page

The parameters on this page are active only if [Geometry Page](#Parameters_-_Geometry_Page) > Type has been set to the Tube type.

Rows `rows` - The first option sets the number of tube sides and the second sets the number of divisions per step length if tube geometry is selected.
Columns `cols` - The first option sets the number of tube sides and the second sets the number of divisions per step length if tube geometry is selected.
Tension `tension` - Tension defines the smoothness of branching corners.
Branch Blend `smooth` - Enabling this option allows a child branch to be continuously joined to its parent branch.
Thickness `thickinit` - This number defines the default tube thickness.
Thickness Scale `thickscale` - This number is the scale factor used with the ! or ? operator.
Apply Tube Texture Coordinates `dotexture` - When enabled, UV texture coordinates are applied to the tube segments, such that the texture wraps smoothly and continuously over branches.
Vertical Increment `vertinc` - Defines the vertical spacing of texture coordinates over tube geometry when tube texture is applied.

Step Size `stepinit` - Step Size allows you to define the default length of the edges when new geometry is generated.
Step Size Scale `stepscale` - Step Size Scale defines the scale by which the geometry will be modified by the " or \_ (double quote, or underscore) turtle operators.
Angle `angleinit` - Angle defines the default turning angle for turns, rolls and pitches.
Angle Scale `anglescale` - Angle Scale allows you to enter the scaling factor to be employed when the ; or @ operators are used.
Variable b `varb` - Substitutes user-defined b, c and d variables in rules or premise. These variables are expanded and so may include system variables such as `$F` and `$T`.
Variable c `varc` - Substitutes user-defined b, c and d variables in rules or premise. These variables are expanded and so may include system variables such as `$F` and `$T`.
Variable d `vard` - Substitutes user-defined b, c and d variables in rules or premise. These variables are expanded and so may include system variables such as `$F` and `$T`.
Gravity `gravity` - This parameter determines the amount of gravity applied to the geometry via the T (tropism vector) turtle operator. **Tropism** is when a plant bends or curves in response to an external stimulus. L-systems employ a tropism vector to simulate this behaviour. The bending is characterised by the fact that the thicker or shorter parts bend less than the longer or thinner parts.

## Parameters - Funcs Page

The parameters on this page allow you to stamp your leaf geometry (each copy can be different) as opposed to simply copying them. See the example in [Example - Stamping L-system Leaves](#Example_-_Stamping_L-system_Leaves).

Pic Image TOP `pictop` - This is the TOP which the pic() function uses. See [#Expressions L-system Specific Expression Functions](#Expressions_L-system_Specific_Expression_Functions) below.
Group Prefix `grpprefix` - If the production g(n) is encountered, all subsequent geometry is included in a primitive group prefixed with this label and ending with the ascii value of n. See [#CreateGroup Creating Groups within L-systems](#CreateGroup_Creating_Groups_within_L-systems) below for an example.
Channel Prefix `chanprefix` - If the expression chan(n) is encountered, it is replaced with the local channel prefixed with this label and ending with the ascii value of n.
Leaf Param A `stampa` - You can determine which parameters are used by leaves.  
 See [#CreateGroup Creating Groups within L-systems](#CreateGroup_Creating_Groups_within_L-systems) below for an example.
Leaf Param B `stampb` - You can determine which parameters are used by leaves.  
 See [#CreateGroup Creating Groups within L-systems](#CreateGroup_Creating_Groups_within_L-systems) below for an example.
Leaf Param C `stampc` - You can determine which parameters are used by leaves.  
 See [#CreateGroup Creating Groups within L-systems](#CreateGroup_Creating_Groups_within_L-systems) below for an example.
Rules DAT `rules` - Path to the DAT defining the rules for the LSystem.

* Context Ignore `context_ignore:` - Defining this in the Rules DAT specifies all characters which are to be skipped when testing context sensitivity in the rules below.
* Premise `premise:` - Define an initial string of characters to which the substitution rules are applied.
* Rules - This is where the turtle substitution rules are defined.

## Rule Substitution

You create the highly structured organic and branching objects using L-systems grammar. An L-system is a process in which a sequence of rules are applied to an initial string of characters to create a new string. To build the geometry, each character of the final string represents one command which affects an imaginary stylus, or "turtle".

The process begins by examining the first character of the premise string. All sixteen rules are searched sequentially until an applicable rule is found. The current character is then replaced with one or more characters as defined by the rule. The remaining characters in the premise string are replaced in a similar fashion. The entire process is repeated once for each generation.

### Limitations to Rules

* Polygon {} and branch [] operators can be nested 30 levels deep
* Rules can be 256 characters in length
* Variables can have up to 5 parameters
* Up to 25 rules can be defined

### Turtle Operators

`+` Turn right

`-` Turn left (minus sign)

`&` Pitch up

`^` Pitch down

`?` Divides current width

`@` Divide current angle

`[` Push turtle state (start a branch)

`]` Pop turtle state (end a branch)

`{` Start a polygon

`.` Make a polygon vertex

`}` End a polygon

`g` Create a new primitive group to which subsequent geometry is added

## Production Rule Syntax

A Touch L-system rule is specified as:

[**lc**<] **pred** [>**rc**] [:**cond**]=**succ** [:**prob**]

where:

* **lc** - Optional left context
* **pred** - predecessor symbol to be replaced
* **rc** - Optional right context
* **cond** - Condition expression (optional)
* **succ** - Replacement string
* **prob** - Probability of rule execution (optional)

### Context Sensitivity

The most basic type of rule is:

**pred** = **succ**

In this case, a character is replaced with the characters of **succ** if, and only if, it matches **pred**.

Premise: `ABC`  
Rule 1: `B=DOG`

will result in `ADOGC`

**pred** can only specify one letter, but left and right context symbols can be specified. The general syntax is [**lc**<] **pred** [>**rc**] = **succ**.

**For example:**

Premise: `ABC`  
 Rule 1: `A<B=DOG`

again results in `ADOGC` because `B` is preceded by `A`. If the rule were: `Z<B=DOG` or `B>A=DOG` the rule would not be applied.

## Parameter Symbols

Each symbol can have up to five user-defined variables associated with it which can be referenced or assigned in expressions. Variables in the predecessor are instanced while variables in the successor are assigned.

The rule `A(i, j) = A(i+1, j-1)`, will replace each `A` with a new `A` in which the first parameter has been incremented and the second parameter decremented.

Note that the variables in the predecessor can also be referenced by the condition or probability portions of the rule.

The rule `A(i):i<5 = A(i+1) A(i+1)`, will double each `A` a maximum of five times (assuming a Premise of `A(0)`).

Parameters assigned to geometric symbols (e.g. `F`, `+`, or `!`) are interpreted geometrically.

The rule `F(i, j) = F(0.5*i, 2*j)`, will again replace each `F` with a new `F` containing modified parameters. In addition to this, the new `F` will now be drawn at half the length and twice the width.

## Operator Override

Normally turtle symbols use the current length/angle/thickness etc. to determine their effect. By providing a turtle operator with an explicit parameter, it will override the value normally used by the turtle operator.

Override parameters for `F`, `f`, `G`, `h`, `H` take the form of:

> `F(i,j,k,l,m)`

* **`i`** - Override Length.
* **`j`** - Override Thickness.
* `k` - Override # Tube Segments.
* `l` - Override # Tube Rows.
* `m` - User parameter.

The **k** and **l** override parameters allow dynamic resolution of tube segments.

### Examples

**`F`** - Moves forward current length creating geometry.

**`H`** - Moves forward half current length creating geometry.

`F(i, j)` - Moves forward a distance of `i,` creating geometry of thickness `j`.

**`H(i, j)`** - Move forward half the distance of `i`, creating geometry of thickness half of `j`.

**`+`** - Turn by current angle amount.   
 **`~`** - Rotate by random angle.

**`+(i)`** - Turn by i degrees.  
 **`~(i)`** - Override random angle with value of `i`.

`$(x0,y0,z0)` - Points the turtle to location `(x0,y0,z0)`.

Given the above, the Premise:

`F(1) +(90) F(1) +(90) F(1) +(90) F(1)`

generates a unit box regardless of the default Step Size or Angle settings.

### List of Operator Overrides

The following list describes the geometric interpretation of parameters assigned to certain turtle symbols:

[![TouchGeometry84.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/3/3a/TouchGeometry84.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry84.gif)

[![TouchGeometry93.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/0/0f/TouchGeometry93.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry93.gif)

[![TouchGeometry98.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/9/91/TouchGeometry98.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry98.gif)

## Edge Rewriting

In The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants, many examples use a technique called Edge Rewriting which involve left and right subscripts. A typical example might look like:

Generations `10`  
Angle `90`  
Premise `F(l)`  
Rules  
`F(l) = F(l)+F(r)+  
 F(r) = -F(l)-F(r)`

However, Touch doesn't know what `F(l)` and `F(r)` are. In this case, we can modify the rules to use parameter passing. For the `F` turtle symbol, the first four parameters are length, width, tubesides, and tubesegs, leaving the last parameter user-definable. We can define this last parameter such that `0` is left, and `1` is right:

Generations `10`  
Angle `90`  
Premise `F(1,1,3,3,0)`  
Rules

After two generations this produces: `Fl+Fr+-Fl-Fr`. There should not be any difference between this final string and `F+F+-F-F.`

Another approach is to use two new variables, and use a conditional statement on the final step to convert them to `F`:

Variable b `ch("generations")`  
Premise `l`  
Rules   
`l:t<b=l+r+  
 r:t<b=-l-r  
 l=F  
 r=F`  
**Output** `l`  
`F`  
`F+F+`  
`F+F++-F-F+`

In the earlier example, the expressions `0.5*i` and `2*j` are used. In fact, expressions can be used anywhere a numeric field is expected. Currently the following symbols can be used in expressions:

`( )` - brackets for nesting priority

`^ + - * / %` - arithmetic operators

`min() max() sin() cos() asin() acos() pic() in()` - supported functions

`== != = < <= > >=` - logical operators

`& | !` - logical operators: and, or, not

`b c d` - SOP b, c, d parameters after expansion

`x y z` - current turtle position

`g` - age of symbol

`t` - time (generations) of L-system

`a` - SOP angle parameter

`T` - SOP tropism (gravity) parameter

The pre-defined variables above should not be used in the arguments of the predecessor.

**For example:** `A(a,b) = B(a*2,b*2)` is wrong (a is the SOP Angle parameter). `a<b (A,B) = b(A+1,B)` is right.

The last statement is correct because `a` and `b` are used as symbols and not variable names. `A` and `B` are correct because variable names are case sensitive.

### L-System Specific Expression Functions

* **`pic(u, v, c)`** - Using the image specified with Pic Image File, this function returns a normalized value (between `0` and `1`) of the pixel at the normalized coordinates `(u,v)`; `c` selects one of four channels to examine:  
  `0`  
  `1`  
  `2`  
  `3`
* **`in(q, r, s)`** - Given a MetaTest input source containing a metaball geometry, this function returns a `1` if the point `(q, r, s)` is contained within the metaball, and `0` if not. Use `in(x, y, z)` (the letters `x`, `y`, and `z` are special and contain the X, Y, and Z location of the turtle) to test whether or not the turtle is currently inside the metaball to create pruned outputs.

### Conditions

Each rule may have an optional condition specified. The syntax is:

[lc<] pred [>rc]:cond = succ

The Rule1 `A:y>2=J` includes source `J` at all `A`'s above the height of `2`.

### Probability

Each rule can specify the probability that it is used (provided it is otherwise applicable). The syntax is:

[lc<] pred [>rc]:cond=succ=prob

Rule1 `A=B:0.5`  
Rule2 `A=C:0.5`

will replace `A` with either `B` or  `C` with equal probability.

## Creating Groups with L-Systems

There is a group operator '**`g`'** which lumps all geometry currently being built into group g.

**For example:** `g[F]` lumps geometry from F into a group called `lsys0`. You can set the lsys prefix from the [Funcs page](#Parameters_-_Funcs_Page).

### Optional Group Parameters

`g` takes an optional parameter as well.

**For example:** `g(1)[F]` lumps geometry from `f` into a group called `lsys1`. If no parameter is given, the default index is bumped up appropriately.

The current group container is pushed/popped with the turtle state so you can do things like:

`gF [ gFF] F` - The first and last `F`'s are put into group `0`, and the middle `FF`'s are put into group `1`.

`gF [ FF] F` - The geometry from all four `F`'s are put into group `0`, (pushing the turtle adopts the parent's group).

To exclude the middle `FF` from the parent's group type: `gF [ g(-1)FF ] F`

## Controlling the Length over Time

To create an L-system which goes forward X percent less for each iteration, you need to start your Premise with a value, and then within a rule, multiply that value by the percentage you want to remain:

Premise `A(1)`  
Rule `A(i) = F(i)A(i*0.5)`

This way "`i`" is scaled before `A` is again evaluated. The important part is the Premise. You need to start with a value to be able to scale that value.

**Step 1)** Place a [Circle SOP](Circle_SOP.html "Circle SOP"), and set the Number of Divisions to`: param("lsys", 3`)

It then displays a triangle (3 is default value).

**Step 2)** Pipe this into the J input of a L-System SOP. If the L-system Premise is:

`J A`  
`J(,,4) A`  
`J(,,5) A`

This way, you can customize each leaf before it gets copied.

**Step 3)** Change the Premise and Rule to:

Premise`A(0)`  
Rule1`A(i)=FJ(,,i+3)A(i+1)`

This creates a line of increasing-order polygons.

**Step 4)** Finally, we will want to create 20 leaves, and put them all into a [Switch SOP](Switch_SOP.html "Switch SOP"). Do this by entering the following expression into the Switch SOP's Select Input: `param("lsys",0)`  
**Step 5)** Then in your L-system, J(,,0) gives you the first SOP, J(,,1) gives you the second, and so on. This solves the problem of a limited number of leaves using only JKM.

Also note that these examples use only the first stamp parameter, you can use up to three parameters: e.g. J(,,1,2,3)

The first two parameters of J, K, M are used to override length and width, like symbol F.

# Luma Level TOP

The Luma Level TOP adjusts image brightness, gamma, black level, quantization, opacity and more. It has similar parameters to the [Level TOP](Level_TOP.html "Level TOP"), but it maintains the hue and saturation more accurately when you use Gamma and Black Level.

In the Level TOP, lowering the gamma will raise the saturation and shift the hue. Luma Level preserves saturation and hue.

It also includes a Source parameter which allows the level adjustment to be applied only to certain parts of the image. For example, if source is set to Luminance, then the adjustments made with the Luma Level's parameters will be applied to the luminance of the image (ie. Invert = 1 would invert the luminance of the image, not the color).

Magnet SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Magnet SOP

The Magnet SOP allows you to affect deformations of the input geometry with another object using a "magnetic field" of influence, defined by a metaball field. It allows the creation of animated bumps and dents within objects, and other special effects.

It is important to note that the actual deformation comes from the Translate parameters of the Magnet SOP, and not from the metaball. The metaball defines the area of effect for the Translate parameters of the Magnet SOP. The weight of the metaball determines the effectiveness of the Translate within the Magnet SOP.

The power of the magnet is greatest at the centre of a metaball field and diminishes to nothing at the edge of the field.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[magnetSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/MagnetSOP_Class "MagnetSOP Class")

* [6 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [6.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Deform Group `deformgrp` - Allows you to specify a group of geometry to be deformed, and a group that will act as the magnet respectively. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Magnet Group `magnetgrp` - Allows you to specify a group of geometry to be deformed, and a group that will act as the magnet respectively. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These three fields move the Source geometry in the three axes. The Translates of the metaball only affect the position of the area of influence. The influence itself is provided by an imaginary magnet within the Magnet SOP itself, and the attitude of this influence is determined by the Translates of the Magnet SOP.

**Note:** If the **Translate** values of the Magnet SOP are all zero, the magnet will have no deforming influence. The weight of the [Metaball SOP](Metaball_SOP.html "Metaball SOP") scales the influence of the Magnet SOP's Translates.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - These three fields scale the input geometry in the three axes.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The pivot point for the transformations. Not the same as the pivot point in the pivot channels.

Affect Position `position` - Allow the magnet to affect the position of the input geometry. This is enabled by default.
Affect Point Color `color` - Allow the magnet to affect the point color of the input geometry.

**Tip:** To control the contribution of each magnet on the surface's Point Color when the **Affect Point Color** option is enabled, set your point colors to black (0,0,0) before the Magnet SOP by using a [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP"). The Translate fields in the Magnet SOP will then add per-point rgb color with values of 2,2,2 approaching white.

The scale and rotate channels of the magnet move you about in 3D color space. This is not recommended.

Affect Point Normal `nml` - Allow the magnet to affect the point normals of the input geometry.
Affect Point Velocity `velocity` - Allow the magnet to affect the velocity of the input geometry.

Extra Information for the Magnet SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

MAT - Derivative

# MAT

[![OP MAT.png](images/b/bc/OP_MAT.png)](File_OP_MAT.html)

See also [Category:MATs](Category_MATs.html "Category:MATs") for a full list of articles related to MATs.

**Material Operators**, or **MATs**, are used to create materials for geometry. They can be applied to geometry using the **Material** parameter on the Display page or any [Object Components](Object_Component.html "Object Component").

The [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT") and [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") are designed to use [TOPs](TOP.html "TOP") and [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") programs (pixel and vertex shaders) as inputs to create more advanced shaders.

The most commonly used MAT is the Phong MAT. The Phong MAT contains a large number of lighting options that allow the users to create some very unique effects.

[Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT") - applies a phong shader to the geometry. Geometry must have [normals](Normals.html "Normals") for specular shading to work. Geometry must have [Texture Coordinates](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Point_Attributes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Point Attributes (page does not exist)") for any applied maps to work (ie Color Map, Bump Map, Specular Map, etc). Geometry can be deformed using the Deform parameter page. The Phong MAT offers other advanced features for [Transparency](Transparency.html "Transparency"), [Rim Lights](Rim_Light.html "Rim Light"), and [Shadows](Shadows.html "Shadows").

[PBR MAT](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT") - applies a PBR shader to the geometry. Use in conjunction with an [Environment Light COMP](Environment_Light_COMP.html "Environment Light COMP"). [Substance Designer](http://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-designer) PBR materials can also be used via .sbsar files loaded into the [Substance TOP](Substance_TOP.html "Substance TOP").

[Line MAT](Line_MAT.html "Line MAT") - renders the geometry edges as lines and points with different geometry.

[Constant MAT](Constant_MAT.html "Constant MAT") - this material applies a constant flat color to the geometry. There is no specular shading, ie shading is not affected by the camera or light positions.

[Depth MAT](Depth_MAT.html "Depth MAT") - can be used to get depth information from the geometry for a depth-pass render. It will not render any color.

[GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") - a powerful material operator which applies Pixel and Vertex GLSL shaders to the geometry. Geometry can be deformed on the GPU using vertex shaders. Geometry must have [Texture Coordinates](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Point_Attributes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Point Attributes (page does not exist)") and [normals](Normals.html "Normals").

[Point Sprite MAT](Point_Sprite_MAT.html "Point Sprite MAT") - special material for use with Point Sprite geometry type. The [Particle SOP](Particle_SOP.html "Particle SOP") can create point sprites.

Math CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Math CHOP

The Math CHOP performs arithmetic operations on channels. The channels of a CHOP can be combined into one channel, and several CHOPs can be combined into one CHOP.

The OP page lets you pre-operate on each sample, like making all samples positive or taking the square of each sample.

Using **Combine Channels**, for an input CHOP with multi-channels, you can multiply the samples of one channel by the samples in the other channels, reducing N channels down to one. You can combine them by multiplying, adding, finding the maximum, etc..

Using **Combine CHOPs**, where there are two or more CHOP inputs, you can multiply (or add, etc.) the channels in one CHOP with the channels in all the other CHOPs, reducing N CHOPs to 1. (otherwise channels of multi-inputs are just merged)

You can then post-operate on the resulting samples - negate, square root, etc.

Then using the Mult-Add page it can offset and scale the values of each sample.

More conveniently you can use the Range page to do linear scaling as well by setting an output low-high range for a certain input low-high range.

Finally, you can round the resulting values off to an integer.

**Tip**: You can affect only certain channels of your input by using the Scope parameter on the Common page.

**Note**: To do logic operations (and, or, ...) between channels or CHOPs, use the [Logic CHOP](Logic_CHOP.html "Logic CHOP").

**Tip: Customizing each channel:**: You can use the local member `chanIndex` in a parameter like Post-Add, for example, `me.chanIndex*2` to give a different post-add value for each channel. `chanIndex` is available in numerous CHOPs like the [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP"). (expressions are non-optimized)

* Subtract `sub` - Subtract all the channels from the first.

* Multiply `mul` - Multiply all the channels.

* Divide `div` - Divide the first channel by all the rest.

Channel Post OP `postop` - ⊞ - A menu (same as Channel Pre OP) is performed as the finale stage upon the channels resulting from the above operations.

* Positive `pos` -

* Root `root` -

Align `align` - ⊞ - This menu handles cases where multiple input CHOPs have different start or end times. All channels output from a CHOP share the same start/end interval, so the inputs must be treated with the Align Options:

* Automatic `auto` - It will trim to the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") if there are any Time Slices, else it will do an Extend Min/Max.

* Extend to Min/Max `none` - Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all inputs to that range using the extend conditions. (see [Extend Conditions](Extend_Conditions.html "Extend Conditions")).

* Stretch to Min/Max `stretch` - Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every channel's start and end to that range.

* Shift to Minimum `start` - Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all start at that index. All channels are extended to the length of the longest one.

* Shift to Maximum `end` - Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the longest one.

* Shift to First Interval `shift1` - Shift all channels to the start of the first CHOP and sample all inputs using the first input's range.

* Trim to First Interval `trim1` - Trim all channels to first CHOP's range.

* Stretch to First Interval `stretch1` - Stretch all channels to the first CHOP's range.

* Trim to Smallest Interval `trim` - Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.

* Stretch to Smallest Interval `squash` - Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.

Interp Pars per Sample `interppars` - Use this option when the input is a higher frequency than the timeline (example: audio). It will avoid any pops or crackles in the output when adjusting the multiply, add or range parameters.
Integer `integer` - ⊞ - The resulting values can be converted to integer.

* Off `off` - Don't affect the value.

* Ceiling `ceiling` - Round a value up to the next integer.

* Floor `floor` - Round a value down to the next integer.

* Round `round` - Round a value to the nearest integer.

## Parameters - Mult-Add Page

The three steps are next performed in the following order:

Pre-Add `preoff` - First, add the value to each sample of each channel.
Multiply `gain` - Then multiply by this value.
Post-Add `postoff` - Then add this value.

This is the final step prior to output.

From Range `fromrange` - ⊞ - Another way to multiply/add. Converts from one low-high range to another range.

* `fromrange1` -

* `fromrange2` -

To Range `torange` - ⊞ - Another way to multiply/add. Converts from one low-high range to another range.

* `torange1` -

Matrix Class - Derivative

# Matrix Class

The matrix class holds a single 4x4 matrix for use in transformations. The matrix's data layout is in [column-major format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-major_order#Column-major_order), which is to say that the matrix is multiplied from the left of [vectors](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class") and [positions](Position_Class.html "Position Class"). The translation values are stored in the last column of the matrix.
A matrix is created with this line, and will always be initialized to the identity matrix.

```
m = tdu.Matrix()

You can also initialize a matrix with an initial set of values. Valid arguments for initialization is another tdu.Matrix, a list of 16 values or 4 lists of 4 values. The entries are specified column-by-column. For example the following lines of code will produce the shown matrix

```
m = tdu.Matrix([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16])

# or
m = tdu.Matrix([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16])

# matrix values
1  5  9   13
2  6  10  14
3  7  11  15
4  8  12  16

You can also get transformation and projection matrices from [Object COMP](ObjectCOMP_Class.html "ObjectCOMP Class") and [Camera COMP](https://docs.derivative.ca/CameraCOMP_Class "CameraCOMP Class") by using the various methods such as `transform(), pretransform(), projection()`.

# Matte TOP

The Matte TOP composites input1 over input2 using the specified channel of input3 as a matte. Using the default setting of Matte Channel = Alpha, white (one) pixels in input3's alpha channel will draw input1 over input2, black (or zero) will make input1 transparent, leaving the input2 image at that pixel.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[matteTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/MatteTOP_Class "MatteTOP Class")

## Parameters - Matte Page

Switch Inputs `switchinputs` - Changes which image is composited over the other. This has the same effect as physically swapping input1 and input2. Also the same as inverting the alpha channel to input3.
Matte Channel `mattechannel` - ⊞ - Select which channel from input3 is used to create the matte.

Extra Information for the Matte TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Merge CHOP

The Merge CHOP takes multiple inputs and merges them into the output. All the channels of the input appear in the output. The channel order is the channels of the first input followed by the channels of the second input, and so on.

Channel names may conflict, but a channel is renamed according to the Duplicate Names menu. The CHOP appends or increments the digits of the channel name until an unused name is found.

When the Time Slice flag on the Common parameter page is on, the Merge CHOP will merge only the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") of a channel, not the entire length of all the channels.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[mergeCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/MergeCHOP_Class "MergeCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Merge Page

* Extend to Min/Max `none` - Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all inputs to that range using the extend conditions. (see [Extend Conditions](CHOP_Channel_Page.html#Extend_Conditions "CHOP Channel Page")).

Duplicate Names `duplicate` - ⊞ - When channels of the input CHOPs have the same name, this menu determines what to do.

* Make Unique `unique` - Include all the input channels, and when there is a conflict of name, make the new channel's name similar but unique by adding digits to the name.

* Keep First `first` - Include the channel of the first input CHOP which the name appears in, and discard any further channels with the same name.

* Keep Last `last` - Include the channel of the last input CHOP which the name appears in, and discard any other channels with the same name.

* Replace First with Last `replace` -

DAT `dat` - Specifies the path to DATs to be merged. Can be used in conjunction with the operator's wired inputs.
How `how` - ⊞ - Sets how tables are merged together.

* Append Rows `row` - Merges tables together by adding rows from subsequent tables to the first table. If the By Name option is used, then data from subsequent tables will be added to the column with the same name, and the first row will not be added. If the subsequent tables have more columns than the input table, they will be appended.

* Append Columns `col` - Merges tables together by adding columns from subsequent tables to the first table. If the By Name option is used, then data from subsequent tables will be added to the row with the same name, and the first column will not be added. If the subsequent tables have more rows than the input table, they will be appended.

* Collapse Columns `collapsecol` - Merges tables together by concatenating all cells in a row into one single cell. You will have one column and one or more rows at the end.

* Collapse Rows `collapserow` - Merges tables together by concatenating all cells in a column into one single cell. You will have one row and one or more columns at the end.

* Collapse Cells `collapsecells` - Merges tables together by concatenating all cells together. You will have one single cell at the end.

* Replace Cells by Column `repcolcells` - Replaces data in the first table with data in subsequent tables, matching by row names. Data from the last table will always be used.

* Replace Cells by Row `reprowcells` - Replaces data in the first table with data in subsequent tables, matching by column names. Data from the last table will always be used.

For example, if your first input table is
```
 Name          Species	  Age				
 Birch	        Ferret	  6			
 Diefenbaker	Ferret	  4

```
and you have two more input tables in the order
```
 Name          Species	   Age				
 Birch	        Ferret	   5			
 Diefenbaker	Wolverine  5

```
```
 Name          Species	  Age				
 Birch	        Ferret	   6			
 Diefenbaker	Otter	   10

```
your output table will be
```
 Name          Species	  Age				
 Birch	        Ferret	   5

By Name `byname` - Specifies if you are appending columns and rows by name.
Concatenate with `spacer` - Allows you to separate the cell data with a string when concatenating. The default is a space.
Append Unmatched `unmatched` - If the subsequent tables have rows or columns that are not found in the first table, these will be added to the output.

Metaball SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Metaball SOP

The Metaball SOP creates metaballs and meta-superquadric surfaces. Metaballs can be thought of as spherical force fields whose surface is an implicit function defined at any point where the density of the force field equals a certain threshold. Because the density of the force field can be increased by the proximity of other metaball force fields, metaballs have the unique property that they change their shape to adapt and fuse with surrounding metaballs. This makes them very effective for modeling organic surfaces. For example, below we have a metaball. The surface of the metaball exists whenever the density of the metaball's field reaches a certain threshold:

[![MetaExample1.jpg](images/9/92/MetaExample1.jpg)](File_MetaExample1.html)

When two or more metaball force fields are combined, as in the illustration below, the resulting density of the force fields is added, and the surface extends to include that area where the force fields intersect and create density values with a value of one. For more information on metaballs, see [Metaballs](Metaball.html "Metaball").

[![MetaExample2.jpg](images/8/80/MetaExample2.jpg)](File_MetaExample2.html)

### Level of Detail for Metaball Display

You can change the level of detail of the metaball and NURBS display by adjusting the Level of Detail parameter in the Display Option Dialog > Viewport page > Level of Detail option. To open the Display Options Dialog, press "p" in a SOP viewport.

Accurate metaball normals will be computed if the normal attribute exists when conversion to polygons is done. Thus, to get improved shading on polygonized metaballs, it's a good idea to add the normal attribute (i.e. use a [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP")) before converting the metaballs.

### What is an Exponent?

In the instance of metaballs, the exponent determines the inflation towards "squarishness" or contraction towards "starishness" as described below:

* Value > 1 - Results in metaballs that appear more like a "star".
* Value < 1 - Results in metaballs that appear more "squarish".
* Value = 1 - Results in metaballs that appear spherical.

MIDI Event DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# MIDI Event DAT

The MIDI Event DAT logs all [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") messages coming into or out of TouchDesigner from all MIDI In/Out operators. Note: no messages will be logged if there are no active MIDI In or Out operators set to receive them. It outputs columns in a table format: message, type, channel, index, value.

The table is FIFO "first-in first-out" and limited to parameter-set number of lines. An optional script may be run for each packet received.

MIDI In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# MIDI In CHOP

The MIDI In CHOP reads Note events, Controller events, Program Change events, System Exclusive messages and Timing events from both MIDI devices and files. See also [MIDI In Map CHOP](MIDI_In_Map_CHOP.html "MIDI In Map CHOP").

The MIDI In CHOP receives [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") events from MIDI devices connected to the serial port, reads MIDI events internal to the workstation (i.e. the built-in software synth), and interprets musical scores in MIDI files. Supported MIDI events are:

Note On, Note Off
Polyphonic Aftertouch
Channel Pressure
Program Change
Control Change (MIDI controller devices)
Pitch Wheel
Timer Events including beat pulses
Bar Messages
Start, Stop, Continue
Song Position Pointer
System Exclusive Messages

MIDI events arriving on separate MIDI channels may be recorded on separate CHOP channels. Also, any number of MIDI CHOPs can read from the same or different sources. TouchDesigner can be configured such that MIDI Start, Stop, or Continue events can control the [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") and [Beat Dialog](Beat_Dialog.html "Beat Dialog").

The 'Simplified Output' option creates a channel for every type of MIDI event received, so number of channels expands while the devices is being used. No need to specify name, channel and index patterns.

**Note**: The values of the MIDI inputs are saved into the TouchDesigner .toe file, and are restored when the file is reloaded. The physical controllers may be in a different position when the .toe is restarted, causing the values to jump when the controllers are moved. This is unavoidable.

## Parameters - Source Page

Active `active` - Enable or disable the MIDI In CHOP.
MIDI Source `source` - ⊞ - Get MIDI input from a device or a file.

* Device `device` - The MIDI events come live from a device.

* File `file` - The MIDI events come from an existing file.

Device Table `device` - Path to the MIDI device [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT")
Device ID `id` - Specify the id of which device to use.
MIDI File `file` - If MIDI file is selected as the MIDI source use this field to specify the name of the MIDI file to read. The file can be read in from disk or from the web. Use http:// when specifying a URL.
Read Entire MIDI File `entire` - If enabled, the entire MIDI file is read. Otherwise, the Start and End parameters on the Channel page determine the segment of the file to read.
Reset Channels `resetchannels` - Deletes all channels when set to On, new channels will not be added until Reset Channels is turned Off.
Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse` - Instantly deletes all channels.
Reset Values `resetvalues` - Resets all channel values to 0 when On, channel values will not be updated until Reset Values is turned Off.
Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse` - Instantly resets all channels to 0.
Simplified Output `simplified` - When this is on channels are automatically created when MIDI signal is detected from the selected MIDI device.
Preserve Pulses `preservepulses` - When on, quick value transitions (pulses) are spaced out over consecutive output samples. Use this option when pulse frequencies approach or exceed the timeline rate, otherwise they risk overlapping each other and being lost.
1 Based Index `onebased` - Make the index 1 based instead of the default 0 based.
MIDI Channels `channel` - The CHOP may read from any number of MIDI channels, numbered 1-16. Ranges and multiple entries are supported (i.e. "1 4 6", "1-7 12", "1-5:2").
If Channel Prefix is left blank, then the input streams from multiple MIDI channels will be combined into one set of CHOP channels (i.e., a "note 64 on" event on channel 12 followed by a "note 64 off" event on channel 8 appears in the note 64 CHOP channel as a single note).
Channel Prefix `prefix` - When recording from multiple MIDI channels, putting a string like "ch" in this parameter causes the MIDI channel to be split into separate CHOP channels per MIDI channel. Otherwise the MIDI channels are all merged into one set of CHOP channels.

## Parameters - Record Page

The parameters here are only enabled when 'Simplied Output' on the Source Page is Off.

Record Method `recordtype` - ⊞ - Determine what to record.

* Single Frame `single` - This only outputs the current value of notes, controllers, etc. It does not retain prior values. It creates a CHOP at frame 1 always, so the CHOP causes cooking only when MIDI events come in.

* Current Frame `current` - Same as "Single Frame", but the CHOP frame is always at the current frame, so the CHOP changes every frame, causing other CHOPs to recook every frame.

* Current Time Slice `ind` - The CHOP frame is always at the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)").

* Full Length `timeline` - The entire length of the timeline is recorded.

Record `record` - This parameter is used as a button to start and stop recording into the CHOP channels.

## Parameters - Note Page

Note Name `notename` - Put an "n" in here to generate channels for note events. It is the base name of the CHOP channel used to record notes. If blank, notes are ignored. If the Note Output parameter is set to Separate Channels, then CHOP channels will be created for each note in the Note Scope, of the form: notename
Note Scope `notescope` - The scope of notes to record. Multiple ranges and notes can be recorded (i.e., "50-60", "64 65 66 70-80").
Note Output `notemeth` - ⊞ - Describes how multiple notes are handled. (As one channel, or individual).

* One Multiplexed Channel `mult` - One CHOP channel per MIDI channel is used for all notes. The value in the note channel is the number of the note currently playing (in the case of multiple notes playing, the most recent note is selected).

* Separate Channels `sep` - Each note number gets its own CHOP channel.

Velocity `velocity` - ⊞ - Describes how multiple velocity events are recorded. (Separate channels or combined in one channel as separate samples).

* Off `veloff` - Velocity is not recorded.

* Note Amplitude `velencode` - The velocity is recorded as the amplitude of the note. Only valid when Note Output is set to Separate Channels.

* Separate Channels `velsep` - Velocity is recorded in separate CHOP channels. Each note channel will have a corresponding velocity channel.

Velocity Name `velname` - When Velocity is set to Separate Channels, this parameter is the base name of the Velocity CHOP channel (try "v"). If blank, no velocity channels will be recorded.
Aftertouch Name `aftername` - The base name of the polyphonic Aftertouch CHOP channels. One aftertouch channel is created for each note in the Note Scope. If blank, no aftertouch channels will be created.
Pressure Name `pressname` - The name of the Channel Pressure channel. If multiple channels are being recorded, all channel pressure changes of interest will be recording on this CHOP channel. If blank, this channel will not be created.
Normalize `notenorm` - ⊞ - Note values can be normalized for convenience:

* None `off` - When Normalize is Off, 7 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-127 and 14 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-16383.

* 0 to 1 `0to1` - These values are normalized to lie in the range 0 to 1.

Pitch Wheel Name `pitchname` - The name of the Pitch Wheel CHOP channel. Pitch wheel values range from -1 to +1. If blank, this channel will not be created. Put "p" in here to generate a channel.

Controller Name `controlname` - The base name of the Control Change CHOP channels. The channel names are appended with the controller index (0-127). If blank, control changes will not be recorded. It typically contains "c".
Controller Type `controltype` - ⊞ - There are 128 different controllers available. By choosing By Index Only, you can specify any number of controllers in the Control Index parameter. Otherwise, you can select a controller from the list from this menu. Some controllers have multiple instances, such as Sound Controllers 1-10. Selecting a controller with multiple instances allows you to use the Control Index parameter to select which instances you want. Any invalid control indices will be ignored.

* By Index Only `index` - Specify the controller by its index, as opposed to specifying a specific type below.

* Bank Select `n0` -

* Modulation Wheel `n1` -

* Breath Control `n2` -

* Foot Controller `n3` -

* Portamento Time `n4` -

* Data Entry `n5` -

* Channel Volume `n6` -

* Balance `n7` -

* Pan `n8` -

* Expression Control `n9` -

* Effect Control 1-2 `n10` -

* 14 bit General Purpose 1-4 `n11` -

* Sustain on/off `n12` -

* Portamento on/off `n13` -

* Sustenuto on/off `n14` -

* Soft Pedal on/off `n15` -

* Legato Footswitch on/off `n16` -

* Hold 2 on/off `n17` -

* Sound Controller 1-10 `n18` -

* 7 bit General Purpose 5-8 `n19` -

* Portamento Control `n20` -

* Effect Depth 1-5 `n21` -

* Non-Registered Parameter `n22` -

* Registered Parameter `n23` -

Controller Index `controlind` - Used to select controllers by number, or multiple controllers by ranges. When in By Index Only Controller Type mode, you can select up to the full 128 controllers or sub-ranges thereof (i.e. "1-10", "2 34 70", "1-32 70-80:2").
Controller Format `format` - ⊞ - Some controllers can be paired together to form 14 bit controllers, rather than the normal 7 bit controllers (controller indices 0-31, 98 and 100). Selecting 14 bit Controllers interprets a pair as one 14 bit controller. Otherwise, they are interpreted as separate 7 bit Controllers.

* 7 bit Controllers `7bit` - Controllers are assumed to be regular 7 bit value messages.

* 14 bit Controllers `14bit` - Controllers are received as two 7 bit value messages.

Normalize `norm` - ⊞ - Controller values can be normalized for convenience:

* -1 to 1 `-1to1` - These values are normalized to lie in the range -1 to +1.

* On/Off `onoff` - Several of the controllers are simply on/off states. When Convert to On/Off is enabled, values greater than or equal to 64 will be interpreted as "1" and all values less than 64 will be interpreted as "0".

Unwrap `unwrap` - When on, values do not jump between min and max, but are modified to be continuous ramps. Use with knob controllers for examples.
Program Change `progname` - The name of the Program Change CHOP channel. All program change messages will be recorded onto this channel. If blank, this channel will not be created.

## Parameters - Timer Page

Timer Pulse Name `pulsename` - Record timer pulse messages.
Timer Ramp Name `rampname` - Record timer ramp messages.
Timer Period `timerperiod` - Record timer period messages.
Timer Start `timerstart` - Record timer start messages.
Ticks per Beat `ticks` - Specify the expected ticks per beat. This will influence the timer and bar output values.
Bar Ramp Name `barname` - Output the current bar position.
Bar Period `barperiod` - Output the current bar period events.
Bar Start `barstart` - Output when a bar starts.
Bar Message `barmsg` - Capture bar messages. Place a V in the message to specify which value the channel should have.
Song Pos Name `songpos` - Capture song position messages.

## Parameters - Sys Page

System Exclusive `sysex` - Sequence of system exclusive message handlers
Channel Name `sysex0name` - Name of a specific exclusive message to be captured.
Message `sysex0msg` - Contents of the exclusive message. Place a V in the message to specify which value the channel should have.

## Parameters - Chan Page

This is similar to other generators' Channel page. However, there are a few points to consider on how they affect the Midi In CHOP.

Start `start` - Defines where recording begins. In "Tie to Time Line" mode, any events received before the start time will be ignored. In "Time Line Independent" mode, recording will start at this point and continue on (not looping back). If reading from a MIDI File, Start/End will determine the start of the segment to read.

Start and end of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples). The parameters are expressed in the `Units` found on the Common page. To set the CHOP to be 100 samples long, Set `Units` to Samples, `Single Frame` Off and `Start` / `End` to 0 and 99.

Start Unit `startunit` - ⊞ - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

* I `samples` - Use samples.

* F `frames` - Use frames.

* S `seconds` - Use seconds.

End `end` - Defines the end of the segment to read for MIDI Files.
End Unit `endunit` - ⊞ - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

Sample Rate `rate` - Defines the sample rate of this CHOP, in samples per second. If the sample rate is too low, a rapidly changing input may be misrepresented.

**Note**: If the sample rate is too low, you may miss MIDI events. A note event may set a sample value to 1, and then the next note event less than 1/30 second later can set it to 0 on the same sample in the CHOP channel. So the event will be missed. Make the sample rate higher, like 600, to catch these events, or make sure that your on-off events coming in are a minimum time separation, as can be achieved through Opcode's MAX.

Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before range).

MIDI In DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# MIDI In DAT

The MIDI In DAT logs all [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") messages coming into TouchDesigner from a specified MIDI device. It outputs columns in a table format - message, type, channel, index, value.

However general setup is simpler. Once you have MIDI set up via the Dialogs -> MIDI Device Mapper, TouchDesigner is ready to receive MIDI via Select CHOPs that point to `/local/maps/map1` for device 1, etc.

MIDI In Map CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# MIDI In Map CHOP

See first the [MIDI In DAT](MIDI_In_DAT.html "MIDI In DAT"). The MIDI In Map CHOP reads in specified channels from the [MIDI Device Mapper Dialog](MIDI_Device_Mapper_Dialog.html "MIDI Device Mapper Dialog") which prepares slider channels starting from s1, s2, etc. and button channels starting with b1, b2 and so on. The MIDI In Map CHOP selects from these channels.

**NOTE**: (Apr 12 09) This page needs to be updated with the info in the release notes.

Another CHOP, the [MIDI In CHOP](MIDI_In_CHOP.html "MIDI In CHOP") retrieves [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") data more directly but it is less portable as it addresses the MIDI channel numbers, note numbers and controller numbers in the CHOP, so in order to change the MIDI mapping, you need to change the settings in TouchDesigner, whereas with the MIDI In Map CHOP, users need only set the mapping in the Dialogs -> MIDI Device Mapper.

# MIDI Out CHOP

The MIDI Out CHOP sends [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI") events to any available MIDI devices when its input channels change. More flexibly, the Python [midioutCHOP Class](MidioutCHOP_Class.html "MidioutCHOP Class") can be used to send any type of MIDI event to a MIDI device via an existing MIDI Out CHOP. In [Tscript](Tscript.html "Tscript"), the `midi` command can output MIDI events.

The MIDI devices can be other software programs (such as midisynth) or devices attached to the serial ports. Channels are used to control the sending of the MIDI events. The channels are evaluated over the last time slice (from the last [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") position to the current).

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events based on any changes to its input channels. The channels have to be named appropriately, like `ch3c14` and `ch7n60`.

An event is sent every time a channel changes its value during this slice. All timing is preserved, as long as the [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") is running in realtime (the "Realtime" flag is in the top menu bar).

Naming the CHOP channels: Channels are mapped to events by their name. Events like notes, controllers and velocities must be followed by the note/controller number (n65, c7). If the number is left off a note event, the note number is the value of the channel. Other events, which are sent to the entire channel, do not need a trailing number (pc, pw). The channel prefix can be used to identify the MIDI channel the event should be sent on (i.e. "ch1n45" assigns that TouchDesigner channel to note 45 messages on MIDI channel 1). Channels can always be renamed with a [Rename CHOP](Rename_CHOP.html "Rename CHOP") before entering the MIDI Out CHOP.

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI velocity as well. The values of the channels entering the MIDI Out CHOPs are sent as the velocity of the note. If Normalize is "None", the channel needs to be 0 to 127. If Normalize is "0 to 1", channel values between 0 and 1 are scaled to be MIDI 0 to 127.

The "Cook Every Frame" option cooks the CHOP every frame, even if the CHOP isn't being displayed. All Volume Off and All Volume On flags are new and emit events for Controller 7 of all 16 channels. MIDI output go in a separate thread to allow output that slows TouchDesigner less. It now works in Time Slice mode for note events and controller events. (Not for Program Change or Sysex messages yet) Note channels only trigger anew Note On when the input channel goes from 0 or less to a value greater than zero. Similar for Note Off events.The channel name determines how it is interpreted.

For example,

ch3n60 - this channel is interpreted as channel3 note 60. A Note On event is sent when the value goes from 0 or less to greater than zero
ch5n - This channel will contain note numbers.¬† The value quantized to an integer, and when the integer value changes, the note of the old value goes off and the note of the new value goes on. If the channel steps from 53 to 78, it sends a Note Off event for note 53, and a Note On event for note 78.
ch14c7 - the value of the channel is sent to controller 7 (volume) of channel 14. By default, the values 0 to 1 are mapped to MIDI value 0 to 127.

These features work in Time Slice mode:

By default, channels are to start with "ch" followed by the channel number (1-16). In the case of notes, it is followed by "n" for notes, then digits for the note number. In the case of controllers, it is followed by "c" and a controller number. These prefixes can be altered. MIDI Out now interprets aftertouch, pressure, pitchwheel channels, and outputs these events to the MIDI stream. Note-normalization is added allowing 0 to 127 and 0 to 1 ranges. MIDI Out reads a bar ramp channel to output MIDI clock events¬† (with a channel popup menu to the parameter to select the channel name). Program change events are implemented through the "pc" channels.both 7 and 14 bit controller events can be output. You can capture a MIDI stream and output it to a file.

MIDI File `file` - The filename of the output MIDI file.
Write MIDI File `writefile` - Writes all the data to a MIDI file.
Channel Prefix `prefix` - The prefix string that all input channels must have in order to extract the channel number from their name (i.e. "ch1note44", with a channel prefix of "ch").
Cook Every Frame `cookalways` - Forces a cook of the CHOP every frame. It should be On because the MIDI Out CHOP will otherwise only cook if the CHOP leads to a graphics display viewer. You want it to cooks whether you are displaying anything or not.

Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - The MIDI Timecode value to send. Should be a reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") object.

Note Name `notename` - The base name of the note channels. If input channels have a number after the name, it is assumed to be the note number. If not, the channel value is assumed to contain the note number.
Aftertouch Name `aftername` - The name of the aftertouch channel.
Pressure Name `pressname` - The name of the channel pressure channel.
Normalize `notenorm` - ⊞ - Values in the range 0-1 are mapped to MIDI value 0-127.

MOD Class - Derivative

# MOD Class

The MOD class provides access to Module On Demand object, which allows [DATs](DAT.html "DAT") to be dynamically imported as modules. It can be accessed with the mod object, found in the automatically imported [td module](Td_Module.html "Td Module"). Alternatively, one can use the regular python statement: import.
Use of the import statement is limited to modules in the search path, where as the mod format allows complete statements in one line, which is more useful for entering expressions. Also note that DAT modules cannot be organized into packages as regular file system based python modules can be.

* [1 Members](#Members)
* [2 Methods](#Methods)
* [3 Usage](#Usage)
* [4 Comparing Usage](#Comparing_Usage)
* [5 Search Path](#Search_Path)

There are three methods to import DATs as modules in a script.

* `import datName`  
  Import the module defined by the DAT named datName. All regular import options are supported (from, as, etc). If a DAT is not found, the regular file system search path is then used.
  ```
  # import a DAT named addMonth
  import addMonths
  
  ```
* `m = mod.datName`  
  Import the module defined by the DAT named datName.
  ```
  m = mod.addMonths(1,2,3)
  
  ```
* `m = mod(pathToDat)`  
  Similar to above, except a path to the DAT can be used.
  ```
  m = mod('myMods/adders').addMonths(1,2,3)
  
  ```

## Comparing Usage[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Section&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Comparing Usage")]

Example using import:

```
import myUtils
a = myUtils.add(5,6)

Same example using mod:

```
a = mod.myUtils.add(5,6)

Example using mod outside the search path:

```
a = mod('/projects/utils/utilsA').add(5,6)

Notice however, that a single import statement will be faster than the case of multiple identical mod statements:

```
import myUtils
a = myUtils.add(5,6)
b = myUtils.add(5,6)
c = myUtils.add(5,6)

will execute faster than:

```
a = mod.myUtils.add(5,6)
b = mod.myUtils.add(5,6)
c = mod.myUtils.add(5,6)

However the above could be rewritten more efficiently like this, which would then execute at the same speed as the import statement:

```
m = mod.myUtils
a = m.add(5,6)
b = m.add(5,6)
c = m.add(5,6)

## Search Path[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Section&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Search Path")]

The current component is searched first.

If the [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") is not found, the local/modules [component](Component.html "Component") of the current [component](Component.html "Component") is then searched.

Next the local/modules [component](Component.html "Component") of each parent is successively searched.

If the [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") is still not found, None is returned.

# Model SOP

The Model SOP holds the surface modeler in TouchDesigner. It is designed to hold raw model geometry constructed using the SOP Editor (aka Modeler). It holds modeled data and cannot be unlocked - protecting you from losing your model data.

Any SOP can be [locked](Lock_Flag.html "Lock Flag") and modified with the modeler.

# Monitors Class

The Monitors class describes the set of all installed [monitor objects](Monitor_Class.html "Monitor Class"). It can be accessed with the monitors object, found in the automatically imported [td module](Td_Module.html "Td Module"). It operates much like a Python list of monitor objects.

```
print(len(monitors))		# number of monitors 
print(monitors[0])			# first monitor in the list
for m in monitors:
	print(m.description)	# print all installed monitors' descriptions

`primary` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> The primary [monitor](Monitor_Class.html "Monitor Class") display.

> The width of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

> The height of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

> The leftmost edge of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

> The rightmost edge of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

> The topmost position of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

> The bottommost position of the combined monitor area, measured in pixels.

`locate(x,y)`→ `td.Monitor`:

> Return the [monitor](Monitor_Class.html "Monitor Class") at the specified mouse coordinates, or None.

`refresh()`→ `None`:

> Causes the application to behave as if a monitor device has changed. [Monitors DAT](Monitors_DAT.html "Monitors DAT") and other sources will be updated. This is typically done automatically by the operating system, but in special cases can be triggered manually with this method.

Monitors DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Monitors DAT

The Monitors DAT is a table of data about all currently detected monitors with information on the resolution, screen positioning, monitor name and description, GPU, and a flag indicating whether it is a primary monitor or not.

You can also set it to display the overall bounds of all the detected monitors.

It runs a callback script when a change in the monitors has been detected. These changes can be that a monitor was plugged in, a monitor was unplugged, the resolution of a monitor has changed, or the primary monitor has changed.

The Monitor DAT returns top/bottom values in lower-left origin coordinates, (0,0) is the lower-left corner of the monitor.

Mouse In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Mouse In CHOP

The Mouse In CHOP outputs X and Y screen values for the mouse device and monitors the up/down state of the three mouse buttons.

When the Active flag is on, the Mouse X and Y positions are output through the channels named in the Position X and Y parameters and the button states are output through the channels named in the Left, Right and Middle Button parameters.

The button values are 0 for Button Up and 1 for Button Down.

The Mouse In CHOP and [Keyboard In CHOPs](Keyboard_In_CHOP.html "Keyboard In CHOP") are sometimes connected to the Position and Active inputs respectively of the [Record CHOP](Record_CHOP.html "Record CHOP") to enable the recording of channels.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[mouseinCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/MouseinCHOP_Class "MouseinCHOP Class")

Active `active` - ⊞ - While **On**, the mouse movement will be output from and the CHOP will cook every frame. When set to **Off** it will not cook and the current mouse X or Y values will not be output. **While Playing** will capture mouse events only when the [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") is playing forward.

Output Coordinates `output` - ⊞ - Controls the range of the mouse Position X and Position Y.

* Normalized `normal` - X and Y mouse positions are normalized to a range of 2 units per monitor. The primary monitor will be -1 to 1 with X=0 and Y=0 at the center of the monitor. Other monitors will be relative to these values. For example a monitor directly to the left of the primary monitor would have values in the range -1 on the right to -3 on the left of it.

* Normalized Aspect `aspect` - Following the same rules as Normalized, but normalized and adjusted to aspect ratio.

* Absolute `absolute` - Raw screen coordinates in pixel units. (0,0) is the bottom left of the primary monitor.

Position X `posxname` - The name of the channel that returns the horizontal movement of the mouse.
Position Y `posyname` - The name of the channel that returns the vertical movement of the mouse.
Left Button `lbuttonname` - The name of the channel that returns the state of the left button.
Right Button `rbuttonname` - The name of the channel that returns the state of the right button.
Middle Button `mbuttonname` - The name of the channel that returns the state of the middle button.
Wheel `wheel` - This channel goes up when the wheel is rolled away from the user and goes down when it is rolled the other way.
Wheel Increment `wheelinc` - The amount that is added or subtracted to the current value of the Wheel channel when the wheel is moved.
Monitor `monitor` - This channel returns which monitor the mouse cursor is currently on.
Panels `panels` - Events are only triggered when the specified panel has focus.

Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.
Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before/after range).

Extend Right `right` - ⊞ - The right extend conditions (before/after range).

Mouse Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Mouse Out CHOP

The Mouse Out CHOP forces the mouse position and button status to be driven from TouchDesigner using the incoming CHOP channels. The `tx` and `ty` channels works in normalized coordinates, ranging from 0 to 1 for the left-to-right and bottom-to-top of the full desktop. If the Desktop is spread over two monitors, tx == 1 is the right of the second monitor.

WARNING: If the incoming channels are changing every frame, it may be difficult to regain control of the mouse without using the keyboard or some other means to kill or suspend the process. However the Mouse Out CHOP does not control the mouse while the incoming channels are constant.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[mouseoutCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/MouseoutCHOP_Class "MouseoutCHOP Class")

Position U `posu` - Channel name to look for that will drive the mouse U position.
Position V `posv` - Channel name to look for that will drive the mouse V position.
Left Button `lbuttonname` - Channel name to look for that will drive the mouse's left button state.
Right Button `rbuttonname` - Channel name to look for that will drive the mouse's right button state.

Movie File In TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Movie File In TOP

The Movie File In TOP loads movies, still images, or a sequence of still images into TOPs. It will read images in `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.tif`, or `.bmp` format. It will read movies in QuickTime's `.mov` format, `.mp4`, `.mpg`, `.mpeg`, `.avi`, `.wmv`, `.dpx`, [Cineform](GoPro_Cineform.html "GoPro Cineform") and [Hap](Hap.html "Hap") Q formats (including Hap Q with Alpha).

It also supports the [NotchLC](NotchLC.html "NotchLC") codec, [EXR](https://docs.derivative.ca/EXR "EXR") files (`.exr`) and some `.swf` and `.flv` Flash files as well as DXT1/3/5 and RG compressed `.dds` files. Images and movies can also be fetched from the web by using `http://` to specify a URL.

Access the hardware decoder on Nvidia GPUs with the Hardware Decode parameter on the 'Tune' page. This supports 10 and 12-bit H264/H265s and YUV 444 files on supporting hardware, converted into 16-bit pixel channels. Other codecs that this also decodes include VP8, VP9, JPEG, AV1, VC1.
More information [here.](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new)

When reading file formats that support higher bit depths such as 10-bit/16-bit/32-bit, an appropriate pixel format will be automatically used as long as the 'Pixel Format' menu on the Common page is left as 'Use Input'. i.e. a 16-bit file will cause each pixel to have 16-bits per color channel automatically.

For a complete list, see [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types").

Examine the state of a Movie File In TOP by attaching an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") to it (see below on Info CHOP). This will show info like movie length, resolution, the number of images per second (the `sample_rate` channel), and whether there is audio in the file. It also shows dynamic information like movie open status, current frame, readahead frames and queue size, dropped frame count, CPU decode time and GPU upload time.

Note that a movie's "images per second" (sample\_rate) may be different than the timeline's frames per second. When referring to the movie's "index", it's in reference to the sequence of images in the movie file, not related to the global project frame rate.

  + [7.3 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

File `file` - The path and name of the image or movie file to load. Image and movie formats are those found in [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types"). You can specify files on the internet using `http://` ...

To treat a folder of images as if they are one movie, specify the folder containing the images instead of a filename. All the files must be the same resolution. It will treat all stills/movies in that folder as if each is a frame in one movie. The order of the images is the alphanumeric. By default the first image has an index of 0, second is 1, etc, regardless of their file names. Overriding the sample rate on the Trim parameter page will let you playback the image sequence at any frame rate.

Using an `info.xml` file in the directory containing a sequence of images allows you to specify the frames per second and an audio file to be used with the sequence of images. Example xml file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" standalone="yes" ?>
  <Settings>
      <attributes fps="30.0" />
      <audio filename="audio.wav" />
  </Settings>

URLs can be used to fetch images and movies. The image or movie is downloaded to the user's Derivative temp directory and is read into the Movie File In TOP.

Reload `reload` - Change from 0 to 1 to force the image to reload, useful when the file changes or did not exist at first.
Reload Pulse `reloadpulse` - Instantly reloads the file.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Specifies the method used to play the movie, there are 3 options.

* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the movie position to the timeline. Scrubbing or jumping in the timeline will change the movie position accordingly. The parameters Play, Reset, Speed, and Index are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to movie position.

* Specify Index `specify` - This mode allows the user to specify a particular position in the movie using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the movie.

Play `play` - Movie plays when 1, movie stops when 0.
Speed `speed` - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is *Sequential*. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on. Negative values will play the movie backwards.
Cue `cue` - Jumps to Cue Point when set to 1. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.
Cue Pulse `cuepulse` - Instantly jumps to the Cue Point position in the movie.
Cue Point `cuepoint` - Set any index in the movie as a point to jump to.
Cue Point Unit `cuepointunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

* I `indices` -

* % `fraction` -

Cue Behavior `cuebehavior` - ⊞ - Customize the Cue parameter's behavior.

* On Release, Repeat Cued Frame `repeat` - When releasing the Cue parameter, immediately play the next frame.

* On Release, Play Next Frame `play` - When releasing the Cue parameter, first play the cued frame before continuing to play the next frame.

Index `index` - This parameter explicitly sets the movie position when Play Mode is set to Specify Index. The units menu on the right lets you specify the index in the following units: Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage). For example, assume you have a movie that internally is 25 fps, and the timeline that is 60 fps. If you set Units to Index and the parameter value to 25, you get the image that is 1 second into the movie. If you set the Units to Frames and set the value to 60 you get the same image at 1 second into the movie.
Index Unit `indexunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Loop Crossfade `loopcrossfade` - Crossfades the beginning and end of the movie together to create a smooth transition when looping. If the movie uses Trim options, it will crossfade Trim Start with Trim End positions.
Loop Crossfade Unit `loopcrossfadeunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Step Size `stepsize` - Sets how many frames to skip before displaying next frame. For example, a StepSize of 30 will display every 30th frame. This timing of movie playback does not change, so with a Step Size of 30 and a sample rate of 30, a new frame will be displayed every second.
Audio Loop `audioloop` - ⊞ - This menu helps you determine how to treat the audio as the end of a movie approaches. This is needed because of all the cases of playing a movie, like when driving with an index, the TOP will not know if you intend to loop it or not.

* Silence `silence` - Audio will go silent when movie ends.

* Fade `fade` - Audio will fade out when movie ends.

* Match Start to End `match` -

Image Sequence Indexing `imageindexing` - ⊞ - Determines how an image sequence is ordered.

* Zero Based `zero` - Index the sequence of images starting at 0, after sorting them alphanumerically.

* Filename Based `filename` - Index the sequence of images using the numbers on the end of the filenames. I.e a file named flower400.tiff will be frame index 400, regardless of if there are other files in the directory before it.

Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - Set the movie index with a reference to a timecode. Should be a reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") object.

## Parameters - Image Page

Interpolate Frames `interp` - Interpolates between frames based based on exact time. For example, if the index (in frames) is 1.5, then frames 1 and 2 will be blended 50-50. If the index is 1.7 then 30% of frame 1 is blended with 70% of frame 2 and so on.
Deinterlace `deinterlace` - ⊞ - For movies that are stored as fields, where each image is made of two images interleaved together. A 30-frame per second movie would contain 60 fields per second. For each image, the even scanlines of the first field are interleaved with the odd scanlines of the second field. The Movie File In TOP has several ways of dealing with this:

* Off `off` - Output the movie images unchanged.

* Even `even` - Take only the even scanlines of the file's images and create the odd scanlines by interpolating between the even scanlines. (For historic reasons, scanline 0 is at the top of the images for the purpose of the deinterlacing.)

* Odd `odd` -

* Bob (Split) `bob` -

Field Precedence `precedence` - ⊞ - Where fields are extracted one field at a time, this will extract the Even field first by default, otehrwise it will extract the odd field first. The video industry has not standardized on one or the other.

* Even `even` - When the disk files are fragmented. The Movie File In TOP will read frames of the movie into memory before they are used, this can eliminate pops or stutters in playback that occur from fragmented files, other resources accessing the hard drive, or movie looping.

Bottom Half is Alpha (AAA) `bottomhalfalpha` - If enabled, the image/movie will have it's height halved, and the R channel from the pixels on the bottom half will be treated as if they were the alpha channel for the top half. Useful for cases where the image format does not support alpha natively.
Multiply RGB by Alpha `multalpha` - ⊞ - Premultiplies the image.

* Automatic `automatic` -

Input is sRGB `inputsrgb` - If the input image is 8-bit and [sRGB](https://docs.derivative.ca/SRGB "SRGB") color space, enable this to have treated as such.
Loading/Error Image `loadingerrorimage` - ⊞ - When the file can not be loaded for some reason, select what to display instead.

* Colored Bottom Right Square `coloredbottomright` - Show a colored square in the bottom right. Red means failed to load, grey means still loading.

* Zero `zero` - Show a blank frame.

## Parameters - Trim Page

Trim `trim` - Enables the parameters below to set trim in and out points.
Trim Start `tstart` - Trim the starting point of the movie.
Trim Start Unit `tstartunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Trim End `tend` - Trim the ending point of the movie.
Trim End Unit `tendunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Extend Left `textendleft` - ⊞ - Determines how the Movie File In TOP handles movie positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the movie's current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the movie position is calculated.

* Hold `hold` - Displays the first frame in the movie range (the frame specified by Trim Start) for any position before Trim Start.

* Cycle `cycle` - Loops the movie range continuously.

* Mirror `mirror` - Loops the movie range in a zig-zag pattern. For example, playing backwards from Trim Start the movie will index will climb towards Trim End, at which point is will decend down towards Trim Start again and continue to zig-zag (or mirror) the further the movie plays backwards.

* Black `black` - Displays black frame for any movie position before Trim Start.

Extend Right `textendright` - ⊞ - Determines how the Movie File In TOP handles movie positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the movie's current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the movie position is calculated.

* Hold `hold` - Displays the last frame in the movie range (the frame specified by Trim End) for any position after Trim End.

* Mirror `mirror` - Loops the movie range in a zig-zag pattern. For example, playing forwards from Trim End the movie will index will start decending towards Trim Start, at which point is will start climbing towards Trim End and continue to zig-zag (or mirror) the further the movie plays.

* Black `black` - Displays black frame for any movie position after Trim End.

Override Sample Rate `overridesample` - Turn On to change the sample rate of the movie. When loading an image sequence, use these parameters to set the playback speed for the sequence.
Sample Rate `samplerate` - Set the sample rate for playback when 'Override Sample Rate' above is On.

Pre-Read Frames `prereadframes` - Sets how many video frames TouchDesigner reads ahead and stores in memory. The Movie File In TOP will read and decode frames of the movie into CPU memory before they are used, this can eliminate pops or stutters in playback that occur from some frames taking too long to decode, other resources accessing the hard drive, or movie looping. When reading a sequence of image, having more Pre Read Frames will allow multiple images to be decode at the same time. This allows playback of heavy file formats such as .exr in real-time, assuming the machine has enough CPU cores.
Frame Read Timeout `frametimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a frame from the hard drive before giving up. If the Disk Read Timeout time is reached, that frame is simply skipped. This also works for network files that are downloaded via http://.
Frame Timeout Strategy `frametimeoutstrat` - ⊞ - When on, if the Disk Read Timeout is reached TouchDesigner will use the latest available frame in place of the skipped frame.

* Keep Frame `keep` - Keep showing the same frame that is currently being output.

* Best for Playback `playback` - Try to pick the best frame for playback. This may be a newer frame that what is shown, but not quite the frame that is requested.

* Best for Seeking `seeking` - Try to show any frame, either before or after the target frame. Good for when seeking the movie via a shuttle widget in a UI.

Always Load Initial Frame `alwaysloadinitial` - If this parameter is turned on, then for the first loaded frame the Frame Read Timeout will be ignored, and it will always wait for the first frame to ensure the node always starts up with a valid image.
File Open Timeout `opentimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a movie to open. If the Disk Open Timout is reached, the Movie File In TOP will stop waiting and make its image all black, with a grey square in the bottom right corner. If the file still isn't opened the next time the TOP cooks, it'll wait again, and do the same. It'll keep doing this until the file is opened, or the open fails.
On Timeout, use Latest Avail `uselatestontimeout` - When on, if the Disk Read Timeout is reached TouchDesigner will use the latest available frame in place of the skipped frame.
Async Upload to GPU `asyncupload` - When enabled, this will use OpenGL features to upload movie images to the GPU asynchronously. This will reduce the cook time of the Movie File In TOP considerably (in the performance monitor the lines that say "Uploading Image to GPU" will go down to almost nothing). There is a GPU memory cost to using this feature however. It uses up another (Width \* Height \* 4 \* Read Ahead Size) bytes of GPU memory. If you are having poor results with this feature, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.
Update Image `updateimage` - Image will not update when set to 0. Movie index will continue to move forward but the output image will not update. This is useful when you are using a Movie Audio CHOP to get audio from the movie, but you don't care about the video.
Max Decode CPUs `maxdecodecpus` - Limit the maximum number of CPUs that will be used to decode certain video codecs that are capable of multi-CPU decoding, such as H264/H265 and Cineform. Note that this does not affect multi-threaded decoding for image sequence playback, which is instead controlled by increasing the Pre-Read Frame parameter.
High Performance Read `highperfread` - This option should be used when playing back files that require very high SSD read speeds such as high resolution (4K+) HAP Q files. It greatly improves read performance in those cases. It should not be used for low resolution or low data rate files such as 1080p H264 files.
High Performance Read Factor `highperfreadfactor` - When doing high performance reads, this parameter controls the size of the read operations that are done on disk. Whatever the largest operation the codec asks to be done, this is multiplied by the read factor and all subsequent reads will read that much data instead. This can result in higher throughput depending on the drives. For example if a request is made to read 1MB and the factor is set to 3, then instead the operations will read 3MB from the disk and the extra 2MB read will be ready for the next frame and will likely already have the next 2 frames available in CPU RAM.
Hardware Decode `hwdecode` - Controls if this node should use hardware decoding via the Nvidia hardware decoder chip. You can check if hardware decoding is being used using the Info CHOP, 'hardware\_decode' channel. This parameter does nothing for Hap and NotchLC codecs, which are always hardware decoded.

Extra Information for the Movie File In TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific Movie File In TOP Info Channels

Movie File Out TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Movie File Out TOP

The Movie File Out TOP saves a TOP stream out to a movie file (`.mov`/`.mp4`) using a variety of codecs, including the H.264/H.265, [Hap Q](Hap.html "Hap"), [NotchLC](NotchLC.html "NotchLC"), [Apple ProRes](Apple_ProRes.html "Apple ProRes") and Animation video codecs. It can also save single frame images, image sequences, or stop-frame movies.

For codecs that support Alpha, use the 'Movie Pixel Format' parameter to select a format that includes alpha.

The [Export Movie Dialog](Export_Movie_Dialog.html "Export Movie Dialog") is a user interface built around the Movie File Out TOP.

To record movies with audio using the Movie File Out TOP, a [Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") CHOP with mono or stereo channels of audio is required. If TouchDesigner is running at a lower frame rate than the target video frame rate and a CHOP is specified for audio, the Movie File Out TOP will automatically repeat video frames to ensure the video and audio stay in sync.

Recording a movie without frame drops can be done in non-realtime by turning off the Realtime flag at the top of the user interface.
The length of the video is not predetermined and depends on the amount of time the Record parameter is on.

You can record a sequence of `.tif` or `.exr` files by setting the Type parameter to Image Sequence. When Image File Type is set to OpenEXR, the EXR page has options to record any number of color channels from multiple TOPs into an EXR image file, and can create it with metadata that would get read by a [Point File In TOP](Point_File_In_TOP.html "Point File In TOP").

**H264/H265 NOTE:** Encoding movies in H.264/H.265 codec is only available with a [Commercial](TouchDesigner_Commercial.html "TouchDesigner Commercial") or [Pro](TouchDesigner_Pro.html "TouchDesigner Pro") license. Nvidia graphic hardware is also required.

**\*\*\* WARNING - GPU Driver Timeout on long GPU activities \*\*\*** Encoding some formats at high-resolution may be a slow, GPU-intensive operation. Generally only the RGBA BC7 mode for HapQ can suffer from this though. Consequently it will usually take longer than the default 2 seconds per frame that Windows gives the GPU driver to complete an operation. If you see a message saying that Windows has reset the GPU driver, this is the issue you are running into. To fix the issue, create this registry value:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\TdrDelay`

The value should be of type `REG_DWORD`. The value is the number of seconds an operation can take before the OS resets the GPU driver. Set it to something larger, like 20-40 (seconds), depending on the resolution you intend to encode. You must reboot your machine for this setting to take effect. If you still get driver resets, make it even larger.

Recording still images and stop-frame animation can be done by changing the 'Type' parameter. Then the 'Add Frame' pulse button can be pulsed manually or via a script to cause the frames to be written.

Header Source DAT `headerdat` - The path to a Table DAT that stores header metadata that should be written to the output image or movie file. Header data is written as key-value pairs with the first column storing the keys and the second column storing the associated values. **Note:** Currently only supported for EXR files. **Warning:** Files may fail to save if the header data conflicts with system headers.

## Parameters - EXR Page

The Inputs page can be used to add extra channels of image data to the output file and to change the names of the base 4 channels.

Each 'Additional Input TOP' is a path to a TOP containing the image data to add to the file. The associated Red, Green, Blue and Alpha parameters are the names assigned to that input's channels in the new file. If the channel parameter is left blank, that channel will not be added to the output file. Channels with duplicate names will be overwritten.

**Note:** Additional inputs are currently only supported in EXR images and sequences. In EXR files, channels are stored in alphabetical order.

Save as Point Cloud `pointcloud` - When enabled, an additional header will be added to the file that indicates the contents are point data rather than images. This header is used to automatically load the file into a [Point File In TOP](Point_File_In_TOP.html "Point File In TOP") rather than a [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP") when dragging and dropping.
Additional Input TOP `input` - Sequence of TOPs containing image data to add to the file
Red `input0r` - Name assigned to the specified TOP's Red channel.
Green `input0g` - Name assigned to the specified TOP's Green channel.
Blue `input0b` - Name assigned to the specified TOP's Blue channel.
Alpha `input0a` - Name assigned to the specified TOP's Alpha channel.
TOP `input1top` - The path to the TOP used to specify addition channels to the EXR file. The first 4 channels specified above come from the input connected to the Movie File Out TOP, this TOPs RGBA data can be assigned unique names in the EXR file using the Red, Green, Blue, Alpha parameters below.

Stall for File Open `stallforopen` - When this is on playback will stall until the file is opened and ready to receive frames, to make sure the frame that was inputted when Record was turned on gets recorded. When this is off recording may start on a later frame, after the file has been opened. Turning this off can avoid a stall in playback, if missing recording some frames at the start is acceptable.
Profile `profile` - ⊞ - Select the H.264 profile to use.

* Auto-Select `autoselect` -

* Baseline `baseline` -

* Main `main` -

Preset `preset` - ⊞ - The H264 preset to use.

* None `none` - Select from the available presets.

* Lossless `lossless` -

Bit Rate Mode `bitratemode` - ⊞ - Select between Constant or Variable bit rate, and regular or high quality bit rate modes.

* Constant (CBR) `constant` -

* Variable (VBR) `variable` -

* Constant HQ (CBR) `constanthq` -

* Variable HQ (VBR) `variablehq` -

Average Bitrate (Kb/s) `avgbitrate` - Set the average bitrate target for the encoding.
Peak Bitrate (Kb/s) `peakbitrate` - Set the peak bitrate allowed for the encoding.
Keyframe Interval `keyframeinterval` - Set the number of frames between key-frames (I-frames) while encoding.
Max B-Frames `maxbframes` - Controls the maximum number of B-frames (bi-directional frames) that will be created between pairs of key-frames.
Motion Prediction `motionpredict` - ⊞ - Controls the quality of the Motion Prediction used when encoding H264/H265.

* Quarter `quarter` -

* Half `half` -

Frame Slicing `frameslicing` - Controls if H264/H265 frames are sliced into multiple pieces, allowing them to be decoded using multiple CPUs more easily.
Num Slices `numslices` - The number of slices each frame is split into.
Entropy Mode `entropymode` - ⊞ - Controls which entropy mode is used for H265 encoding.

* CABAC `cabac` -

* CAVLC `cavlc` -

Secondary Compression `secondarycompression` - [Hap](Hap.html "Hap") uses a secondary CPU compression stage usually. Encoding video without this compression will result in faster playback, but potentially larger file sizes (which would require faster drives to play back).
Encode Test Mode `encodetestmode` - This mode disables file writting, and only does the encoding. This is useful to test the GPU/CPU performance of encoding while taking the SSD speed out of the equation.
Include Mip Maps `mipmaps` - When saving out .dds file, mipmaps can be included if this is enabled. This is primarily used for the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP"), which will encode special information into the mipmap levels of the texture which needs to be maintained.

Extra Information for the Movie File Out TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific Movie File Out TOP Info Channels

* last\_frames\_written - The number of frames written to the file on the last cook. This many be multiple repeats of the same image if TouchDesigner dropped frames, to ensure time stays in sync.

moviefileinTOP Class - Derivative

# moviefileinTOP Class

This class inherits from the  [TOP class](TOP_Class.html "TOP Class").
It references a specific [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP").

`fileHeight` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Height of the movie, in pixels.

`fileWidth` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Width of the movie, in pixels.

`hasAudio` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the movie contains audio.

`hasDecodeErrors` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if any frames failed to decode, likely due to file corruption. Currently only works on Hap codec files.

`index` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Current movie index.

`indexFraction` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Current movie index expressed as a fraction of total length.

`isFullyPreRead` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the movie has pre-read all of its Pre-Read frames and is ready to play. For single images this is true when the image is ready to be shown. When a movie is playing, this member will flip between True and False as its pre-read frames get consumed/refilled. When a movie isn't playing forward, this member can tell you if the movie is in an optimal state to start playing back from its currently selected frame/cued frame.

`isInvalid` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the movie has failed to load.

`isLastFrame` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the movie is currently showing its last frame.

`isLoopFrame` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the movie has just looped and is showing the first frame after a loop.

`isOddField` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the current displayed de-interlaced frame is the odd field.

`isOpen` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True if the file has been opened.

`isOpening` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True when the file is opening.

`isPreloading` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> True when the file is preloading.

`lastIndexUploaded` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The index of the if the last frame uploaded to the GPU.

`numHeaders` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns the number of key-value pairs in the file's header.

`numImages` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The number of images in the movie.

`numSeconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The number of seconds in the movie.

`rate` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The movie sample rate.

`sourceChannels` → `tuple` **(Read Only)**:

> A list of the available channels in the file e.g. R, G, B, A for typical color images.

`start` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The start index of the movie.

`trueIndex` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The actual current index of the movie, disregarding trimming and other options.

`trueNumImages` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> The actual number of images contained in the movie, not affected by trimming.

> Get a Timecode object for the timecode data representation of the true current index of the movie. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class").

`findHeader(key)`→ `str`:

> Returns the value of the header with the given key. This method will return a blank string if the header is not found.
> 
> * key - The name of the header to search for.

`getHeader(index)`→ `tuple`:

> Returns a tuple with the key and value of the header at the given index. This method will throw an error if the index is not valid. The numHeaders member can be used to get the number of valid headers in the file.
> 
> * index - The index of the header to search for starting with 0.

`unload(cacheMemory=False)`→ `None`:

> Unloads the movie and frees its memory usage. The movie will open again next time it cooks, so make sure nothing is still using it to keep it closed.
> 
> * cacheMemory - (Keyword, Optional) If True, this will attempt to avoid freeing the GPU memory used to upload/display the movie. This memory can be then re-used by a future movie that is opened, assuming it has the same resolution and codec. This can help avoid stutters that occur during file loading. This isn't nesseary to do when using preload() within a single Movie File In TOP, since preload() automatically try to re-use memory. It can be useful if a different Movie File In TOP will be later opened with the same resolution/codec. Single frame movies and images are always unloaded after they are done opening, except for the final texture used for the TOP.

`preload(index)`→ `None`:

> Preloads the movie by opening it and pre-reading the first frames. Use the isFullyPreRead member to see if it's ready to play. This is done in a way to minimize impact on the existing playback of the application. If movies are being loaded on startup it's better to just call cook() on the Movie File In TOP instead of preload() since cook() will be more thorough.
> 
> * index - (Optional) If specified the movie will be opened at the specified frame index. If not, then the movie will be opened at the index specified by its parameters.

`cudaMemory()`→ `CUDAMemory`:

> Copies the contents of the TOP to a newly allocated block of raw CUDA memory. The CUDA memory will be deallocated when the returned [CUDAMemory](CUDAMemory_Class.html "CUDAMemory Class") object is deallocated. Ensure you keep a reference to the returned object around as long as you are using it.

# MQTT Client DAT

The MQTT Client DAT receives and sends data from/to [MQTT](MQTT.html "MQTT") devices via MQTT servers (broker). TouchDesigner can act as a client and another computer needs to act as a MQTT Server. Once a client establishes a connection with a server, it can do two things:

1. Send a message to the server to express interest in any data that has a specific "topic" string. This is called "subscribing". Then the MQTT Client DAT will receive all messages that the server gets with that topic.
2. Inform the server that it will send messages to the server with a certain topic string, and then send messages with that topic. The messages then get forward to any client that has expressed interest in that topic.

See also [MQTT](MQTT.html "MQTT"), [TCP/IP DAT](TCP/IP_DAT.html "TCP/IP DAT").

Active `active` - Enable the connection.
Network Address `netaddress` - The address of the broker to connect to. The address should take the form `<protocol>://<host>:<port>`. Accepted protocol URIs can include `tcp`, `ssl`, `ws`, and `wss`.
Specify ID `specifyid` - Allows naming the client with parameter `User Client ID`, otherwise automatically and uniquely generated for each connection.
User Client ID `usercid` - Client name when `Specify ID` enabled.
Keep Alive Interval `keepalive` - Specifies in seconds, the maximum time to expect without communication. If no data is sent during this time, a lightweight ping message is sent to the server instead. Can be set to 0 to avoid pings.
Max in Flight `maxinflight` - Controls how many messages can be in-flight simultaneously.
Clean Session `cleansession` - If `Specify ID` is selected, the server will preserve any state information associated with the connection of that ID, such as subscriptions, delivery attempts, etc.

# Multi Touch In DAT

The Multi Touch In DAT is used for receiving messages and events from the Windows standard multi-touch API. It captures all the messages, where each new message changes the table it outputs. When a messages is added to the DAT, any script can be called pointing to the new message. The Multi Touch In DAT can be sent to the [Render Pick DAT](Render_Pick_DAT.html "Render Pick DAT"), or used with interactTouch methods in the [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") and [Web Render TOP](Web_Render_TOP.html "Web Render TOP"). Multi Touch DAT is not supported on macOS.

It can output either of two table formats: (1) Raw Events as a FIFO (first in - first out) list, or (2) ID Table, which is the events processed into a more usable one-row-per-finger table.

The Raw Events format creates a FIFO-type DAT (see also [FIFO DAT](FIFO_DAT.html "FIFO DAT")) which, for each multi-touch event, has a row added to the bottom of the table while at the same time a row at the top is deleted.

Note: To operate panel gadgets with multi-touch screens that send events through the Windows event stream, multi-touch works without requiring DATs. You need to use the DAT when using multiple fingers on one panel, like in a container displaying a 3D render whose objects you want to pick.

The ID table format includes the columns:

* `id` - every finger press increases the id by 1
* `sn` - an ongoing count of each finger press.
* `select` - when 1, this row represents a finger is down.
* `downf` - the absolute frame number when the finger press occurred.
* `upf` - the absolute frame number that the finger press ended
* `x`, `y` - the position, in pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions. `NOTE`: The `x` and `y` values are expressed in screen pixels, not panel width/height pixels. For example, the top-right corner of a panel will be different if the panel is scaled within another panel, window or network viewer. It is better to use `u` and `v`, and scale them by the panel Width and Height.
* `u`, `v` - the position, 0 to 1 in the horizontal and vertical directions
* `downu`, `downv` - the position, 0 to 1 in the horizontal and vertical directions when the touch first occured (ie. initial touch down location).

`contactx`, `contacty` - the width of the contact area.
`contactu`, `contactv` - the height of the contact area.

* + `monitor` - monitor number, starting with 0
* `clicktime` - like `downf`, in seconds
* `elapsedtime` - the number of seconds that finger has been down.
* `changedtime` - the time since the finger press that the most recent u or v value changed.
* `dclick` - double-tap occurred
* `aux` - user supplied data via the [PanelCOMP\_Class](PanelCOMP_Class.html "PanelCOMP Class") method `interactTouch()`. When the event is triggered by the mouse via the Include Mouse option, `aux` will include the mouse buttons used (`1` for left, `2` for middle, `4` for right, can be tested bitwise).

You can use the attached callback DAT (named `mtouchin1_callbacks`) to react to multi-touch events. This is suitable for 2D interfaces that do not require a [Render Pick DAT](Render_Pick_DAT.html "Render Pick DAT").

See the [Palette:multiTouch](Palette_multiTouch.html "Palette:multiTouch") example in the [Palette](Palette.html "Palette") under Tools.

See also the [MultiTouch](MultiTouch.html "MultiTouch") page.

Ncam CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Ncam CHOP

The Ncam CHOP receives camera tracking data from an external [Ncam Reality system](https://www.ncam-tech.com/) for use in virtual production. The data is received over a network using the TCP protocol and includes information on the camera's position, orientation and optical properties. This data can be used in a [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") to render content from a virtual environment that is synced to the movement of a physical camera. An [Ncam TOP](Ncam_TOP.html "Ncam TOP") can also be used to receive image data from the camera and to composite it with the rendered content.

For additional tracking solutions, see the [Stype CHOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/Stype_CHOP "Stype CHOP") and [FreeD CHOP](FreeD_CHOP.html "FreeD CHOP").

Ncam TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Ncam TOP

The Ncam TOP can receive image data from an external Ncam Reality tracking system for use in virtual production. To receive data, the TOP must reference an [Ncam CHOP](Ncam_CHOP.html "Ncam CHOP") that is connected to the Ncam server. The type of image displayed in the TOP is chosen using the Output parameter. Multiple image streams may be available depending on the server settings, and additional Ncam TOPs can be used to access more than one stream.

Possible image streams include the primary film stream captured by the external camera, a lens distortion map, and a depth image. The lens distortion map is a 32 bit floating point image where the R and G channels contain coordinates of where that pixel's color data should be taken from. The distortion map is used to warp a rendered image so that it matches the optical properties of an image captured with a physical lens.

The lens distortion map can be applied to a rendered image by connecting a TOP with the rendered content to the Ncam TOP's input and setting the Output parameter to 'Distort Input'. Additionally, the rendered content can be distorted and composited onto the film content using the 'Composite' option.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[ncamTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/NcamTOP_Class "NcamTOP Class")

## Parameters - Ncam Page

Active `active` - Turn this parameter off to stop receiving image data from the Ncam server. The Ncam server only sends the image streams that are requested by active TOPs. Deactivating the TOP does not deactivate the CHOP.
Ncam CHOP `chop` - A link to the Ncam CHOP that is connected to the Ncam server. An Ncam CHOP is required for the TOP to receive any data, but more than one TOP can be connected to the same CHOP.
Output `output` - ⊞ - Select what type of output this TOP should produce. Some output modes like 'Composite' and 'Distort Input' require an input image from another TOP. Not all image streams may be available from the Ncam server. If a stream is not available, the TOP will produce an error.

* Composite `composite` - Apply the lens distortion map to the input image and combine it on top of the film stream using the input image's alpha as a mask.

* Distort Input `distort` - Apply the lens distortion to the input image.

* Distort Passthrough `distort_passthrough` - Output the raw distortion map. The map can be used to distort an image separately using a [Lookup TOP](Lookup_TOP.html "Lookup TOP") or [GLSL TOP](GLSL_TOP.html "GLSL TOP").

* Film Passthrough `film_passthrough` - Output the raw film image captured by the physical camera.

* Depth Passthrough `depth_passthrough` - Output the raw depth image calculated by the Ncam Reality system.

NDI DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# NDI DAT

The NDI DAT lists in a table and monitors all NDI sources and streams found on the network. Callbacks are provided to trigger actions when sources are added/removed/changed and when streams start/stop.

See [NDI](NDI.html "NDI"), [NDI In TOP](NDI_In_TOP.html "NDI In TOP") and [NDI Out TOP](NDI_Out_TOP.html "NDI Out TOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[ndiDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/NdiDAT_Class "NdiDAT Class")

Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Script callbacks for events relating to NDI sources and streams.
Extra Search IPs `extraips` - By default NDI searches using mDNS, which is usually limited to locate networks. To find sources available on machines not reachable by mDNS, this parameter can be filled with a space-separated list of one or more IP address.
Persistence (ms) `persistence` - Persistence affects how long an entry in the DAT stays present even after the source has disappeared. This allows for a source to disappear for a bit and then reappear without being removed from the list.

# NDI In TOP

The NDI In TOP will obtain its image data over IP from other DI® (Network Data Interface) enabled applications. The [NDI®](NDI.html "NDI") protocol is created by [Newtek](http://www.newtek.com/ndi/applications/).

Attach an [Audio NDI CHOP](Audio_NDI_CHOP.html "Audio NDI CHOP") to the NDI In DAT to extract audio from the NDI stream.

Metadata can also be sent to the NDI In TOP from an [NDI Out TOP](NDI_Out_TOP.html "NDI Out TOP") or another system that has attached metadata to the NDI stream. Attach an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") to the NDI In DAT to get the metadata as text. It is in an XML format. To better see and access the XML, attach an [XML DAT](XML_DAT.html "XML DAT") to the Info DAT.

But you can also send a table-format DAT in the [NDI Out TOP](NDI_Out_TOP.html "NDI Out TOP") and it will be received in the Info DAT as a table.

To send metadata in an NDI stream, see the NDI Out TOP's Metadata DAT parameter.

To see details of the available NDI streams, use the [NDI DAT](NDI_DAT.html "NDI DAT").

See also [NDI](NDI.html "NDI"), [NDI Out TOP](NDI_Out_TOP.html "NDI Out TOP") and [NDI DAT](NDI_DAT.html "NDI DAT").

## Parameters - NDI Out Page

Active `active` - Makes itself available as a source and sends out image data when active.
Source Name `name` - Specify the name for this source.
Failover Source Name `failovername` - If this source fails while receivers are connected to it, they will instead try to connect to the specified Failover Source. This format of this should be `MACHINENAME (SourceName)`. This format is the same as you would see the source listed in the NDI In TOP.
FPS `fps` - Specify the frame rate to send at. Note that NDI uses the FPS partially as a guide to control how to compress the frames. The higher the FPS, the more compressed the frames will be. So for example sending at 1 FPS will result in higher image quality that sending at 30 FPS.
Low-Performance Behavior `lowperformancebehavior` - ⊞ - When the NDI sending thread isn't able to keep up due to insufficient system resources (usually available CPU time), this controls the resulting behavior of the node.

* Stall Main Thread `stallmainthread` - The main thread will stall, giving up it's resources so the NDI sender can keep-up with the frames that are being sent. This will likely result in the main thread dropping frames.

* Skip Frames `skipframes` - The main thread will not stall, and instead will not give the sender new frames until it has processed the ones it currently has. This can result in the NDI sender being starved of CPU time and running at a far lower FPS than the main thread.

Output Pixel Format `outputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Controls the pixel format the output is encoded into.

* 8-bit `fixed8` - 8-bits fixed per color channel.

* 16-bit `fixed16` - 16-bit fixed per color channel.

Include Alpha `includealpha` - Also sends the alpha channel when this is turned on. If this is off the alpha will be 1.0.
Group Names Table `grouptable` - Can be DAT table with a column with the header 'groups'. Each cell listed under that heading is added as one of the NDI groups this output annouces itself as part of.
Audio CHOP `audiochop` - Specify the [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") (containing audio data) to send out on the NDI stream.
Metadata DAT `metadata` - Specify the [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") (containing the metadata in table format **or** valid XML format) to send out on the NDI stream. The metadata can be read in by the [NDI In TOP](NDI_In_TOP.html "NDI In TOP") using an Info DAT.

Extra Information for the NDI Out TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific NDI Out TOP Info Channels

* num\_connected - The number of receivers connected to this source.

* last\_send\_time - Amount of time the sending thread took to send the last frame, in milliseconds.

* skipped\_frames - The total number of frames produced by TouchDesigner that didnt get sent out.

Noise CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Noise CHOP

The Noise CHOP makes an irregular wave that never repeats, with values approximately in the range -1 to +1.

It generates both smooth curves and noise that is random each sample. It uses the same math as the [Noise SOP](Noise_SOP.html "Noise SOP").

You can create several curves with different shapes, and you can adjust period, amplitude, harmonics and more.

Optionally, an input can be connected. It is assumed that the input contains 1 to 3 channels representing X, Y and Z coordinates of points in space, and are used to sample anywhere in 3D noise space. One index in the input produces one sample in the output.

All noise functions work identically with [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") on and off, with the exception of Harmonic Summation and Brownian whose methods cannot be limited to 1 in Time Slice mode. When the [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline") wraps around to frame 1, the noise functions will continue uninterrupted.

  + [8.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Noise Page

Type `type` - ⊞ - The noise function used to generate noise. The functions available are:

* Sparse `sparse` - Produces high quality, continuous noise based on Sparse Convolution.

* Hermite `hermite` - Quicker than Sparse, but produces lower quality noise.

* Harmomic Summation `harmonic` - Sparse noise with the ability to control the frequency step of the harmonics. Slowest type.

* Brownian `brownian` - Works like a bug in random flight. With Num of Integrals at 2, its acceleration is changed randomly every frame.

* Random `random` - (White Noise) Every sample is random and unrelated to any other sample. It is the same as "white noise" in audio.

* Alligator `alligator` - Cell Noise.

Seed `seed` - Any number, integer or non-integer, which starts the random number generator. Each number gives completely different noise patterns, but with similar characteristics.
Period `period` - The approximate separation between peaks of a noise cycle. It is expressed in Units. Increasing the period stretches the noise pattern out.

Period is the opposite of frequency. If the period is 2 seconds, the base frequency is 0.5 cycles per second, or 0.5Hz for short. Hz refers to Hertz, the electrical and audio engineer of the 19th century, not the car guy.

If the Type is set to Random, setting this to zero will produce completely random noise. Otherwise, the period should be greater than zero.

Period Unit `periodunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, Seconds, or Fraction.
Harmonics `harmon` - The number of higher frequency components to layer on top of the base frequency. The higher this number, the bumpier the noise will be (as long as roughness is not set to zero). 0 harmonics give the base shape.

Harmonics with a base frequency of 0.1Hz will by default produce harmonics at 0.2Hz, 0.4Hz, 0.8Hz, etc. (up to the number of harmonics specified by the Harmonics parameter).

Harmonic Spread `spread` - The factor by which the frequency of the harmonics are increased. It is normally 2. A spread of 3 and a base frequency of 0.1Hz will produce harmonics at 0.3Hz, 0.9Hz, 2.7Hz, etc. This parameter is only valid for the Harmonic Summation type.
Roughness `rough` - Controls the effect of the higher frequency noise. When roughness is zero, all harmonics above the base frequency have no effect. At one, all harmonics are equal in amplitude to the base frequency. When roughness is between one and zero, the amplitude of higher harmonics drops off exponentially from the base frequency.

The default roughness is 0.5. This means the amplitude of the first harmonic is 0.5 of the base frequency, the second is 0.25, the third is 0.125. The harmonics are added to the base to give the final shape. The Harmonics parameter and the Roughness parameter must both be non-zero to see the harmonic effects.

Exponent `exp` - Pushes the noise values toward 0, or +1 and -1. (It raises the value to the power of the exponent.) Exponents greater than one will pull the channel toward zero, and powers less than one will pull peaks towards +1 and -1. It is used to reshape the channels.
Num of Integrals `numint` - Defines the number of times to integrate (see the Area CHOP p. 114) the Brownian noise. Higher values produce smoother curves with fewer features. Values beyond 4 produce somewhat identical curves. This parameter is only valid for the Random noise type.
Amplitude `amp` - Defines the noise value's amplitude (a scale on the values output).
Reset `reset` - Only available if operator's `Time Slice` Parameter is on. Toggling this parameter will reset the noise calculation and hold the value until the parameter is released again.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Only available if operator's `Time Slice` Parameter is on. Pulsing this parameter will reset the noise calculation.

The Translate, Rotate, Scale and Pivot parameters let you sample in a different part of the 3D noise space. Imagine a different noise value for every XYZ point in space. Normally, the Noise CHOP samples the noise space from (0,0,0) along the X-axis in steps of 2/period. `/tx /ty /tz /rx /ry /rx /sx /sy /sz /px /py /pz`

By changing the transform, you are translating, rotating and scaling the line along which the Noise CHOPs samples the noise space. A slight Y-rotation is like walking in a straight path in the mountains, recording your altitude along the way, then re-starting from the same initial location, walking in a slightly different direction. Your altitude starts off being similar but then diverges.Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Changing the Transform Order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T \* R \* S \* Position

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz \* Ry \* Rx

Translate `t` - ⊞ - XYZ translation values.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - XYZ rotation, in degrees.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - XYZ scale to shrink or enlarge the transform.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - XYZ pivot to apply the above operations around.

Constraint `constraint` - ⊞ - Constraint and its parameters allows the noise curve to start and/or end at selected values. The mean value may also be enforced. **Note:** This only works when Time Slice is Off because time slicing has no pre-determined start/end.

* None `none` - No constraints set.

* Start Value `start` - Sets the noise starting position to the value set in 'Starting Value' parameter below.

* End Value `end` - Sets the noise ending position to the value set in 'Ending Value' parameter below.

* Mean Value `offset` - Sets the noise mean position to the value set in the 'Mean Value' parameter below.

* Start/End Values `endpoints` - Set the starting and ending position of the noise separately using the parameters below.

Starting Value `constrstart` - Value for the starting position.
Ending Value `constrend` - Value for the ending position.
Mean Value `constrmean` - Value for the mean value of the noise.
Normalize `normal` - Ensures that all noise curves fall between -1 and 1. Applied before the Amplitude parameter. Only valid for Random and Harmonic Summation noise types, since Hermite and Sparse noise are always normalized. Normalizing random noise occurs between integrations, producing a more controlled curve. **Note:** This only works when Time Slice is Off because time slicing has no pre-determined start/end.

Channel Names `channelname` - You can creates many channels with simple patterns like "`chan[1-20]`", which generates 20 channels from chan1 to chan20. See the section, Common CHOP Parameters for a description of this and all Options. See [Scope and Channel Name Matching](CHOP_Common_Page.html#Scope "CHOP Common Page") Options. Each channel has a unique seed, so all channels will be different with the same parameter settings.
Start `start` - Start of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples).
Start Unit `startunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
End `end` - End of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples).
End Unit `endunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second. Default: `me.time.rate`
Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before/after range).

Extra Information for the Noise CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Harmonics `harmon` - The number of higher frequency components to layer on top of the base frequency. The higher this number, the bumpier the noise will be (as long as roughness is not set to zero). 0 Harmonics give the base shape.

Exponent `exp` - Pushes the noise values toward 0, or +1 and -1. (It raises the value to the power of the exponent.) Exponents greater than one will pull the channel toward zero, and powers less than one will pull peaks towards +1 and -1. It is used to reshape the channels.
Number of Integrals `numint` - Defines the number of times to integrate (see the [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP")) the Brownian noise. Higher values produce smoother curves with fewer features. Values beyond 4 produce somewhat identical curves. This parameter is only valid for the Random noise type.
Amplitude `amp` - Defines the noise value's amplitude (a scale on the values output).
Keep Computed Normals `keepnormals` -

The Translate, Rotate, Scale and Pivot parameters let you sample in a different part of the 3D noise space. Imagine a different noise value for every XYZ point in space. Normally, the Noise SOP samples the noise space from (0,0,0) along the X-axis in steps of 2/period.

By changing the transform, you are translating, rotating and scaling the line along which the Noise SOPs samples the noise space. A slight Y-rotation is like walking in a straight path in the mountains, recording your altitude along the way, then re-starting from the same initial location, walking in a slightly different direction. Your altitude starts off being similar but then diverges.

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the transforms will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block.

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - The rotational matrix presented when you click on this option allows you to set the transform order for the rotations. As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - Translate the sampling plane through the noise space.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - Rotate the sampling plane in the noise space.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - Scale the sampling plane.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - Control the pivot for the transform of the sampling plane.

Noise TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Noise TOP

The Noise TOP generates a variety of noise patterns including perlin, simplex, sparse, alligator and random. Some types of noise run on the CPU, while others are calculated on the GPU. The ones that are calculated on the GPU will have GPU in their name.

The first input can be combined with the generated noise in various ways depending on the parameters.

The second input can be used to specify noise coordinates per-pixel. Without a 2nd input connected, the noise coordinates are the 0-1 texture coordinates of the output texture, i.e, the position of the pixel in the output texture. With a 2nd input connected the position of the pixel in the output texture is used to look-up into the 2nd input, and the RGBA of the 2nd input for that sampled pixel will be used as the XYZ and W for the noise coordinate.

The Translate, Rotate, Scale and Pivot parameters let you sample in a different part of the 3D noise space. Imagine a different noise value for every XYZ point in space. Normally, the Noise CHOP samples the noise space from (0,0,0) along the X-axis in steps of 2/period.

Derivative (Slope) `derivative` - Turn this on to output the derivative (also known as slope) of the noise function. Currently, only supported for Simplex2D, Simplex3D, Perlin2D and Perlin3D noise types. For 2D noise derivatives, the RG channels get populated with the XY derivatives. For 3D noise derivatives, the RGB channels get populated with the XYZ derivatives. Note that this calculates derivative of the noise function not derivatives along the noise image.

* Input 0: Composite Input - Control the Composite operation via the parameters on the Output Page of this operator.
* Input 1: Noise Coordinate Map - A texture specifying the 2, 3 or 4 dimensional lookup into the noise field.

Notch TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Notch TOP

The Notch TOP will load a Notch Block (extension `.dfxdll`) compiled from [Notch Builder](https://www.notch.one/products/notch-builder/). For Commercial and Educational licenses there is a limit of 2 active blocks at a resolution 1920x1080.

**Note: [CodeMeter Runtime](https://www.wibu.com/support/user/user-software.html) v7.60+ is now required to load Notch blocks.**

Loading the Notch Block into the Notch TOP will generate custom parameters for all the exposed properties in the block. They are split up by page, with each page representing a layer of the block. The output layer can be selected using the 'Layer' parameter.

The custom parameter labels will be generated using the Exposed Name of the exposed property with any special characters or spaces removed. If the Unique Identifier is custom (and not the default auto-generated value) then it will be used as the name of the custom parameter instead. Using a custom Unique Identifier on all exposed properties is recommended for TouchDesigner.

**Enabling Debug Logging:** To diagnose issues with Notch blocks, you can enable logging by setting a Windows Environment variable TOUCH\_NOTCH\_LOGGING=1.

If the block fails to load and the Notch TOP throws the error: **"Failed to load the Notch Block"**, then it may be due to one of a couple reasons:

1. The installed CodeMeter Runtime version is out of date. A minimum of v7.60 is required (see above). To verify the version number check under Help > About in the CodeMeter Control Center.
2. WupiEngine32.dll and WupiEngine64.dll files are missing. This may occur if Notch Builder is not installed or only a Playback license is used. To resolve this: install Notch and locate the missing dll's in the install directory (default under C:\Program Files\Notch), and copy them to /bin within the desired TouchDesigner install directory (eg. C:\Program Files\Derivative\TouchDesigner.2023.12120\bin). After copying, restart TouchDesigner if it is open.

## Parameters - Notch Page

Active `active` - The active state of the node/block. When active, the node will actively render the block. If disabled, the node will release its instance of the block, and unload it if there are no other instances (ie. no other Notch TOPs with the same block). This will allow the block (`.dfxdll`) to become editable again. If re-activated, the block will be reloaded along with any changes.
Clear Parameter Values on File Change `clearparams` - When enabled, all parameters will be cleared. When disabled, it will keep parameter values for exposed parameters of the same name when the Notch Block file changes.
Block `block` - Specify the .dfxdll file (ie. Notch Block).
Layer `layer` - The layer used as the output to the Notch TOP.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - A menu to specify the method used for playback of the block.

* Locked to Timeline `lockedtotimeline` - This mode locks the animation position to the timeline.

* Specify Index `specifyindex` - This mode allows the user to specify a particular index (position) in the animation using the Index parameter below.

* Sequential `sequential` - This mode plays continually.

Initialize `init` - Initialize the playback of the block. This will reset it to the start, but not move forward with playback.
Start `start` - Start the playback of the block. This will reset it to the start and begin playback.
Play `play` - Enable playback of the block. When disabled and in Sequential mode the playback will be paused.
Speed `speed` - The speed of the playback.
Index `index` - The index of the playback when Index mode is selected.
Index Unit `indexunit` - ⊞ - Sets the units used in the Index parameter.

# Null CHOP

The Null CHOP is used as a place-holder and does not alter the data coming in.

It is often used to [Export](Export.html "Export") channels to parameters, which allows you to experiment with the CHOPs that feed into the Null without having to un-export from one CHOP and re-export from another.

The Null CHOP also has options to force-cook nodes downstream from it, or the opposite, to stop cooking nodes downstream if its inputs are not changing.

[![NullCHOP.jpg](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/3/35/NullCHOP.jpg)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:NullCHOP.jpg)

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[nullCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/NullCHOP_Class "NullCHOP Class")

Cook Type `cooktype` - ⊞ - This controls how nodes downstream from the Null CHOP are triggered for recooking when the Null CHOP output changes. See also: [Cook](Cook.html "Cook")

* Automatic `auto` - Downstream nodes are triggered for recooking normally.

* Always `always` - This node and dirty upstream nodes will cook every frame. Downstream nodes will recook every frame their data is requested.

* Selective `selective` - Select which criteria will cause downstream nodes to require recooking, using the parameters below. This option can optimize your network by reducing the number of cooks downstream if the upstream CHOP has inputs that are time dependent or changes often, but output is mostly static (e.g. a Math CHOP rounding a constantly changing float to 0 or 1). The downside is that the nodes upstream of the Null will cook whenever something changes, even if no data is requested downstream. See [Cook](Cook.html "Cook") for more information on when data is requested.

Check Values `checkvalues` - Recook when the Null CHOP values change.
Check Names `checknames` - Recook when the Null CHOP channel names change.
Check Range `checkrange` - Recook when the Null CHOP channel range changes.

Please note that downstream cooks may also cook for a variety of reasons including viewing the contents of the data while editing nodes, etc.

Nvidia Background TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Nvidia Background TOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This TOP uses the AI Green Screening module from the [Nvidia Maxine Video Effects](https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine) engine and requires a 20, 30 or 40 series Nvidia RTX card to operate.

The Nvidia Background TOP performs AI image segmentation to separate a person from the background of a given image. Unlike the [RGB Key TOP](RGB_Key_TOP.html "RGB Key TOP") or the [Chroma Key TOP](Chroma_Key_TOP.html "Chroma Key TOP"), the background top uses AI to identify the foreground and background portions of the image and does not require a solid background color. However, the AI model is trained to look for specific image patterns (a person in front of a webcam) and may not perform as well on generic input as the key TOPS. The output of the node is a monochrome key image where white pixels indicate the foreground person and black pixels represent the background. Commonly, this key image is used to replace the background of the source image using the [Matte TOP](Matte_TOP.html "Matte TOP") or other compositing nodes.

Due to the time it takes to run the AI model, the output of the Background TOP will be multiple frames behind the original image when processing a video input. For accurate compositing you will want to match the output key image with the original frame that was used to produce it. An easy way to do this is to use a [Cache TOP](Cache_TOP.html "Cache TOP") with the Output Index set to a negative number of frames. When placed between the source video and the compositor input, this will delay the source image so that it synchronizes with the key image.

Tip: The AI model is tuned for a single person sitting in front of a webcam. Videos including full body images, multiple people or indirect camera angles may not perform well.

Tip: In addition to selecting Performance using the mode parameter, you can also reduce GPU load by reducing the resolution of the input image. The [Blur TOP](Blur_TOP.html "Blur TOP") and [Level TOP](Level_TOP.html "Level TOP") may also be useful to refine the output key image before compositing.

**Hardware:** This TOP uses the [Nvidia Maxine Video Effects](https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine) engine and requires a 20, 30 or 40 series Nvidia RTX card to operate.

The Nvidia Denoise TOP uses AI models to remove different types of noise from a still image or movie while retaining original details and crispness. The TOP will reduce different types of noise depending on the setting of the Mode parameter. Each mode can also be set to a low or high strength level to control how much noise is removed.

The denoising engine only supports videos with a *width from 80-1920 pixels* and *height from 90-1080 pixels*.

Nvidia Flex Solver COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Nvidia Flex Solver COMP

The Nvidia Flex Solver COMP is a physics solver COMP similar to the [Bullet Solver COMP](Bullet_Solver_COMP.html "Bullet Solver COMP").

In an Nvidia Flex simulation, the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP is analogous to the world/simulation in which actors/bodies (ie. Actor COMPs) operate. An Nvidia Flex Solver COMP contains any number of actors/bodies (Actor COMPs) or force fields (Force COMP), and as the name suggests it uses [Nvidia's FleX particle physics API](https://developer.nvidia.com/flex).

The Nvidia Flex Solver COMP runs an Nvidia Flex simulation based on some simulation parameters (eg. particle radius and cohesion) and updates the transformations of the Actor COMPs contained within it as the simulation progresses forward.

The Actor COMPs referenced by the Nvidia Flex Solver COMP do not need to be inside its network. They can be anywhere as long as they are not already referenced by another Solver COMP (Nvidia Flex or Bullet).

**Note:** Recent driver versions break certain features (such as multiple colliders), so it is recommended to use Nvidia driver version 546.xx. As a result, Nvidia Flex will also have issues on more recent Nvidia cards like those in the **Nvidia RTX 50 series**, which have a minimum driver of 570.xx.

# Nvidia Flex TOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This feature is only available on systems with a Nvidia GPU.

The Nvidia Flex TOP can grab the Nvidia Flex simulation data of an [Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP"). The Actor COMP must be in a valid [Nvidia Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex "Flex") simulation (ie. controlled by an [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html "Nvidia Flex Solver COMP")).

The data will be stored in the texture with each color channel storing a data component. Eg. For positional data the resulting texture is 32-bit float RGBA with x positions in the red channel, y positions in the green channel, and z positions in the blue channel.

See also: [Flex](https://docs.derivative.ca/Flex "Flex"), [Nvidia Flex Solver COMP](Nvidia_Flex_Solver_COMP.html "Nvidia Flex Solver COMP"), [Actor COMP](Actor_COMP.html "Actor COMP"), [Force COMP](Force_COMP.html "Force COMP")

Each simulation block has its own fuel level, the emitter tries to change any blocks it overlaps with to match its emitter value. The correction rate is how strongly it tries to change the value to this target value, for example if 0 the emiitter won't do anything, when a small value like 0-1 the emitter will gently influence the simulation, when a high value like 10-100 it will force the value.
Fuel Release Temp `fuelreleasetemp` - THe temperature required in the system to trigger addition Fuel Release set in the parameter below.
Fuel Release `fuelrelease` - An additional amount of fuel is released into the system when the Fuel Release Temperature threshold set above is met. TIP: This can help simulate solid fuels where heat must be applied for a gaseous fuel to be released.
Alloc Scale `allocscale` - The emitter allocates 'blocks' to contain the simulation. This parameter controls this where 0.0 turns off emitter allocation, 1.0 is default, and values greater than 1.0 can help pre-allocate which can be useful when the direction of the simulation is difficult to predict.

The effect of this parameter can be visualized by turning 'Show Blocks' parameter On in the [Nvidia Flow TOP](Nvidia_Flow_TOP.html "Nvidia Flow TOP").

Nvidia Upscaler TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Nvidia Upscaler TOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This TOP uses the [Nvidia Maxine Video Effects](https://developer.nvidia.com/maxine) engine and requires a 20 series or later Nvidia card to operate.

The Nvidia Upscaler TOP upscales the resolution of an input video. It can run either the [Upscale Filter](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/maxine/vfx-sdk-programming-guide/index.html#upscale-filter) or [Super-Resolution Filter](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/maxine/vfx-sdk-programming-guide/index.html#super-res-filter). The Upscale Filter is faster and offers a Strength parameter. The Super Resolution mode is higher quality and doesn't offer a Strength parameter, but it does have an optional Artifact Reduction toggle. Refer to the Table [Scale and Resolution Support for Input Videos](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/maxine/vfx-sdk-programming-guide/index.html#upscale-filter) for the requirements of the input resolution.

OAK Device CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OAK Device CHOP

The OAK Device CHOP serves as the main interface to an OAK camera. It also implements many of the features of the Timer CHOP such as timer counters, pulses, and custom Python callbacks.

### Basic Usage

Before starting TouchDesigner, connect any OAK Devices to the computer via USB or Power over Ethernet (PoE). If you connect any devices while TouchDesigner is running, you should pulse the Refresh Device List parameter on the OAK Device CHOP. Next, customize the Python createPipeline callback and pulse the start parameter to start the camera. It's ok if you save a project while a camera is running. The camera will know to automatically start when the project opens next time.

### Resolution and ISP Scale

The `depthai` python module has an enum for RGB resolution: [dai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/references/python/?highlight=dai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution#depthai.ColorCameraProperties.SensorResolution). This enum currently includes THE\_1080\_P, THE\_1200\_P, THE\_4\_K, and many others. These options may not necessarily be compatible with your OAK hardware. The most commonly available RGB resolution is 1080p. You can save on bandwidth by selecting a lower resolution via the ISP scale. Selecting (2, 3) with THE\_1080\_P will result in a 1280x720 image.

### Configs

The DepthaiTestSuite.toe project includes several base components which help control settings of an OAK camera by sending messages via an OAK Device CHOP. For example, the oakDeviceConfig base enables the user to set the XLinkChunkSize, logging level, and infrared laser settings of a device. The oakCameraControl base helps control RGB camera settings. The oakStereoDepthConfig base helps control stereo depth settings. It is possible to use these configs while the camera is running.

### Optimizing Latency and FPS

Luxonis has a tutorial on [low latency](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/tutorials/low-latency/). In some cases such as streaming 4K video, you'll want to set [XLinkChunkSize](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/references/python/?highlight=xlinkchunksize#depthai.GlobalProperties.xlinkChunkSize:~:text=disables%20consistent%20timesyncing-,setXLinkChunkSize,-(self%3A) to zero. This can be done with the oakDeviceConfig.

When creating `depthai` pipelines, it's possible to set FPS targets for various nodes such as the [ColorCamera](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/color_camera/) node. In general, the FPS cannot be changed after the pipeline has been loaded on the camera. You should pick high FPS values, but keep in mind that if you push these numbers too high, you may see the effective FPS as shown by an Info CHOP begin to fall.

## Parameters - OAK Page

Active `active` -
Sensor `sensor` - Select the available OAK Device from the dropdown.
Refresh Sensor List `refreshpulse` - Refresh the list of available Sensors.
Initialize `initialize` - Initialize is the signal to get the OAK Device into a ready state: The `onInitialize()` callback is run and on succesfully concluding will run the `createPipeline()` callback. It indicates that its ready by turning the `ready` channel on.
Start `start` -
Play `play` - The built-in Play parameter can toggle whether or not TouchDesigner processes the new messages it receives from the camera. For example, suppose multiple OAK Select CHOPs or TOPs are connected to the same OAK Device CHOP. By toggling play off, you will make all the OAK Select operators continue to receive whatever their most recently received message was, ignoring any new messages.
Go to Done `gotodone` -
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The path to the DAT containing callbacks for this OAK Device CHOP.

## Parameters - Stream In Page

The built-in page named Stream In helps with sending RGBA 8-bit images from TouchDesigner to an OAK camera. You can specify a TOP, a stream name, and a sending frequency in Hertz. If the stream name is blank, nothing will be sent. When sending images to the OAK, TouchDesigner will convert the input image to BGR format. This is convenient because most of the neural networks which can be run on the OAK camera expect the input images to be BGR format. If you require the image to be something else, you should use the [ImageManip](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/nodes/image_manip/) node in your `depthai` pipeline to change the format.

Stream `stream` - Sequence of stream info parameters
Name `stream0name` - Specify the name of the stream that can receive textures. The stream needs to be created in the depthai pipeline by creating a XLinkIn node: `pipeline.create(dai.node.XLinkIn)`
Frequency (Hz) `stream0frequency` - Specify the frequency at which a texture is being send to the OAK device.
TOP `stream0top` - Specify the TOP operator that contains the texture to be send to the stream.

Initializing `outinit` - Outputs channel `initializing` = 1 while the OAK Device is initalizing (i.e. while the callback `onInitialize()` returns non-zero).
Initialize Fail `outinitfail` - Outputs channel `initialize_fail` = 1 if the OAK Device ran into an error while initializing or creating the pipeline.
Ready `outready` - Outputs channel `ready` which is 1 after an Initialize and before a Start.
Running `outrunning` - Outputs channel `running` which is 1 after a Start and before the Done.
Done `outdone` - Outputs channel `done` = 1 when done or complete.
Timer Count `outtimercount` - ⊞ -

Running Time Count `outrunningcount` - ⊞ - Outputs the "wall-clock" time since Start occurred, no matter if the device's `Play` parameter was turned off or not. Will stop counting when the `Done` state has been reached.

OAK Select CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OAK Select CHOP

The OAK Select CHOP is like a [Script CHOP](Script_CHOP.html "Script CHOP") combined with a [Select CHOP](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP"), and any of the other hardware-specific CHOPs. The basic operation involves providing an [OAK Device CHOP](OAK_Device_CHOP.html "OAK Device CHOP") and a stream name. In the simplest case, the stream's data will show up as well-named channels. For example, [ImgDetections](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/) messages indicating the 2D coordinates and labels of detected objects will show up as CHOP channels without any manual coding. In more complex cases such as hand landmark tracking, the stream may be of [NNData](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/nn_data/) or [Buffer](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/buffer/) type, requiring the user to implement a callback and parse the data.

Active `active` - Toggle whether the OAK Select CHOP cooks.
OAK Device CHOP `chop` - An OAK Device CHOP running a depthai pipeline.
Stream `stream` - The name of the stream to be received.
Queue Size `queuesize` - For memory efficiency, this parameter controls the number of messages TouchDesigner reuses when receiving messages from OAK. See "Queue Size" below.
Max Items `maxitems` - This parameter helps the OAK Select CHOP output a consistent number of channels. When running an image detection pipeline, the number of detected items will vary from frame to frame, but we want TouchDesigner to output a consistent number of channels.
Output Format `outputformat` - ⊞ - The default option "Items As Separate Channels" enables time-slicing while "Items as Separate Samples" does not. If the stream is one which automatically fills in the CHOP, then "Items as Separate Samples" is a useful way to make the CHOP output **Max Items** samples consistently.

* Items As Separate Channels `itemsaschannels` -

* Items As Separate Samples `itemsassamples` -

Use First Sample Only `firstsample` - Only use the most recently received message with the OAK Select CHOP. For example, for an IMU stream which is sending very high-frame rate data, toggling this parameter will only show the latest sample.
Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the CHOP. The default sample rate is `me.time.rate`.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Specifies the DAT which holds the callbacks.
Setup Parameters `setuppars` - Clicking the button runs the setupParameters() callback function.

Extra Information for the oakselect CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Script CHOP Functionality[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Script CHOP Functionality")]

The OAK Select CHOP mimics the [Script CHOP](Script_CHOP.html "Script CHOP") in several ways. There's a callback for `onSetupParameters`, where custom parameters can be added. Also, in the other callbacks such as `onReceiveNNData`, `onReceiveBuffer`, and `onReceiveSystemInformation` it's possible to append channels and write data. When implementing a custom callback like below, if you want to disable time-slicing or set the number of output samples, the **Output Format** parameter should be "Items as Separate Samples".

```
import depthai as dai
def onReceiveNNData(oakSelectOp, oakNnData: dai.NNData):
    oakSelectOp.clear()
    oakSelectOp.appendChan('foo')
    oakSelectOp.numSamples = 1  # Output Format must be "Items as Separate Samples"
    oakSelectOp['foo'][0] = 42    
    return

### Queue Size[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Queue Size")]

The Queue Size parameter helps TouchDesigner avoid holding onto too many messages while also re-using memory for a minimum number of messages. For example, picking 2 is a good choice because TouchDesigner can show 1 message to the user while 1 remaining message can asynchronously be written to with new data. However, if the stream is meant to be high frame-rate, such as [IMU](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/imu_data/) data, then the queue size should be at least double the number of messages you expect to receive in a single TouchDesigner frame. If TouchDesigner were to drop a video frame, then the next cook would want to use two times the number of messages that would have normally be shown, requiring the queue size to be at least twice as large.

### Max Items[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Max Items")]

Some messages can be described as items. For example, [ImgDetections](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/) can be grouped into item0's channels, item1's channels, item2's channels and so on. For these kinds of streams, it can be helpful to have a constant number of channels in the OAK Select CHOP, regardless of whether an item exists in the most recent message.

### Output Format[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Output Format")]

The default Output Format is "Items as Separate Channels". For example, when receiving [ImgDetections](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/) from MobileNet, each detection would require 6 channels ("confidence", "label", "xmin", "xmax", "ymin", "ymax"). The total number of channels would be 6 times the **Max Items** built-in parameter. In this situation, time-slicing is enabled, so the number of samples will vary according to time-slicing.

If you're willing to sacrifice time-slicing, you can set the output format to "Items as Separate Samples". This will shuffle the latest messages into 6 channels by **Max Items** samples. In other words, each ImgDetection item will correspond to a CHOP sample. Another reason to use "Items as Separate Samples" is if you're implementing a callback such as `onReceiveNNData` and need to set the number of samples (`oakSelectOp.numSamples = 1`).

### Use First Sample Only[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Use First Sample Only")]

Like the [Shuffle CHOP](Shuffle_CHOP.html "Shuffle CHOP"), the **Use First Sample Only** parameter makes it easy to only use the most recently received message with the OAK Select CHOP. For example, an IMU stream might be sending very high-frame rate data, and toggling this parameter on would be like using a [Trim CHOP](Trim_CHOP.html "Trim CHOP") in "Absolute" value mode to only show the latest sample.

### Info CHOP[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=OAK_Select_CHOP&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Info CHOP")]

When an OAK Select CHOP is connected to an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP"), in addition to the regular cook-related channels, there will be a few OAK-specific ones:

* sequence\_num: (see "sequenceNum" in the depthai [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_detections/))
* messages\_received: the total number of messages received with stream name set on the OAK Select CHOP
* fps: The effective frames-per-second of this stream, i.e., how quickly TouchDesigner is receiving messages. This is not the target FPS of the stream.

OAK Select TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OAK Select TOP

The OAK Select can receive images of many different formats from the OAK Camera. These formats include RGB, monochrome, depth images, and XYZ [Point Clouds](https://docs.derivative.ca/Point_Clouds "Point Clouds").

Active `active` -
OAK Device CHOP `chop` -
Stream `stream` -
Cache Size `cachesize` - The Cache Size parameter works like the Queue Size parameter on the [OAK Select CHOP](OAK_Select_CHOP.html "OAK Select CHOP"). Picking 2 is a good default choice because it enables TouchDesigner to show an image to the user while asynchronously writing new data into the remaining buffer.
Output Index `outputindex` - This parameter mimics the Output Index parameter of a [Cache TOP](Cache_TOP.html "Cache TOP"). When using a more complex depthai pipeline such as the hand tracking example, the hand tracking data will arrive at TouchDesigner with greater latency than the RGB images. By using a negative output index, the images can be delayed so that they better align with the tracking data.
Output Index Unit `outputindexunit` - ⊞ -

Limit Max `limitmax` - When the stream is a depth image (and the stream name actually contains the word "depth"), it can be helpful to limit the maximum "z-depth" of the image. This value is measured in meters.
Output Format `outputformat` - ⊞ - TouchDesigner can apply basic image-processing that depthai does not yet do. For example, if the Output Format is "Point Cloud", the stream is a depth stream, and the stream name contains "depth", then the image in the OAK Select will be a 32-bit XYZ point cloud derived from the depth image and the camera's intrinsic matrix.

* Point Cloud `pointcloud` -

### Specific oakselect TOP Info Channels

* sequence\_num - see "sequenceNum" in the depthai [documentation](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/messages/img_frame/)

* messages\_received - The total number of messages received with stream name set on the OAK Select TOP.

* fps - the effective frames-per-second of this stream, i.e., how quickly TouchDesigner is receiving messages. This is not the target FPS of the stream.

`unlockDevice()`→ `None`:

The OAK Device CHOP has several callback methods copied from the Timer CHOP class. These are `onInitialize`, `onReady`, `onStart`, `whileRunning`, and `onDone`. One new callback is `onInitializeFail` which is called whenever the body of `onInitialize` raises an error. The more important new callback is `createPipeline(oakDeviceOp): -> dai.Pipeline`. This method must return a [depthai.Pipeline](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/api/en/latest/components/pipeline/). If you browse the examples from the Luxonis documentation, there is often a function called `create_pipeline`, which you can sometimes copy with few modifications.

When starting a camera with the OAK Device CHOP, the order of events is the following:

1. The built-in parameters for "initialize" or "start" are pulsed.
2. The `onInitialize(oakDeviceOp, callbackCount)` method is called with callbackCount set to 1. The user-defined code should return a non-negative integer. Returning a positive number will result in waiting that many frames until `onInitialize` is called again. Note that `onInitialize` is a good place to download any files that might be necessary for the pipeline. Several of the TouchDesigner OAK examples demonstrate this by downloading neural network files asynchronously with the **blobConverter** and **fileDownloader** components.
3. Once `onInitialize` returns zero, the `createPipeline` method is called, and the user-defined code must return a pipeline. Note that it's not yet possible to interact with the `depthai.Device` instance in this callback because the Device hasn't been created yet. Such interactions would have to wait until the `onReady` or `whileRunning` callbacks.
4. The `onReady` method is called. This indicates that the pipeline has been loaded on the OAK device and the device has communicated to TouchDesigner that it's running. Note that it is not a guarantee that all streams are working or have been received, but in most circumstances it means that data is about to be received. At this point any OAK Select CHOPs and TOPs that are set to active and have correctly named Stream Names will begin to receive data.
5. Once the built-in parameter for "start" is pulsed, the `onStart` method will be called, and the timer-related functionality of the OAK Device CHOP will proceed.
6. While the device is running, for every frame the `whileRunning` method will be called.
7. If "gotodone" parameter is pulsed while the device is running, the `onDone` callback will be called.

Note that you can restart the timer functionality by pulsing the start parameter of a camera that is already running. The pipeline will not be recreated and loaded on the camera. So if you need to create a new pipeline (possibly with different settings), then you should pulse the initialize parameter one more time.

Object CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Object CHOP

The Object CHOP compares two objects and outputs channels containing their raw or relative positions and orientations. The information that can be output is:

* Position of one object relative to another
* Rotation of one object relative to another
* Bearing of one object relative to another
* Single Bearing Angle between two objects
* Distance between the origin of two objects
* Inverse Square of the Distance between two objects

The optional two inputs allow you to compare X,Y,Z points in world space with objects or each other. The inputs are expected to have three channels containing XYZ points (three channels with the suffix x, y and z). Alternatively, they can be in the standard transform formats as described by the [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP") help. These inputs replace the target and/or reference objects. Object and points can be compared with each other, but "Rotation" mode will always return zero.

See also the [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") and the [Parameter CHOP](Parameter_CHOP.html "Parameter CHOP"). They retrieve other information from [objects](Object.html "Object") and [SOPs](SOP.html "SOP").

## Parameters - Object Page

DAT Table `dat` - Uses a [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") to specify the target and reference objects to use. The first column will be the target objects while the second column will be the reference objects. No headers are used.
Target Object `target` - The object that is being compared to the position of the reference object. The Target Object can be expressed as a text string. This can be useful when the object name needs to be a variable - it allows you to type in a name which may include expressions or variables.
Reference Object `reference` - The object that acts as the origin of the comparison. The Reference Object can be expressed as a text string.
Swap Target/Reference `swaptargetreference` - Swap the objects defined above in the Target Object and Reference Object parameters.

Compute `compute` - ⊞ - Specify the information to output from the objects as described in the parameters below. Except for 'measurements', these match the standard transform formats as described by the [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP").

* Transform (Euler) `transform` - A transform using euler (rx ry rz) for the rotation.

* Transform (Quaternion) `transformquat` - A transform using quaternion (qx qy qz qw) for the rotation.

* 4x4 Matrix `mat` - A 4x4 transform matrix.

* 3x3 Matrix `mat3` - A 3x3 transform matrix. This includes scale/rotation but no translation.

* Measurements `measure` - Enables the toggles below to select what to measure. Measurements give you one object's position relative to another. You get the XYZ of the origin of the Target Object relative to the origin and rotation of the Reference Object. That is, you get the XYZ of the target object's origin as if you were at the 0,0,0 location (origin) of the Reference Object, looking down the Reference Object's Z-axis.

Position `translate` - The displacement from the reference object to the target object.
Rotation `rotate` - The orientation difference from the reference object to the target object.
Scale `scale` - The scale difference from reference object to the target object.
Quaternion `quat` - The quaternion from reference object to the target object.
Bearing `bear` - The rotation necessary for the reference object to be facing the target object.
Single Bearing Angle `singlebear` - An angle representing where the target object is relative to the reference object. Zero degrees is directly in front, 90 degrees is beside and 180 degrees is behind.
Distance `distance` - The distance between the two objects.
Inverse Square Distance `invsqr` - The inverse squared distance between the two objects, useful for modeling electric forces, audio dropoff and gravity.
Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - The transform order to use for Rotation, Scale, Transform, Bearing, or Single Bearing Angle Compute modes.

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - The rotation order to use for Rotation, Scale, Transform, Bearing, or Single Bearing Angle Compute modes.

Include Order Channels `includeorderchans` - Turn on to include channels for Transform Order and Rotate Order.
Bearing Reference `bearingref` - ⊞ - Bearing requires a direction to use as a reference base.

* Bearing Vector `vector` -

Bearing Vector `bearing` - ⊞ - An arbitrary base direction for the bearing calculation.

* X `bearingx` -

* Y `bearingy` -

* Z `bearingz` -

Point Scope X `tscopex` - When one of the optional point inputs is connected, this determines which channels represent X, Y and Z.
Point Scope Y `tscopey` - When one of the optional point inputs is connected, this determines which channels represent X, Y and Z.
Point Scope Z `tscopez` - When one of the optional point inputs is connected, this determines which channels represent X, Y and Z.
Append Attributes `appendattribs` - Adds a rotate attribute to any rotation channels the Object CHOP creates.
Smooth Rotation `smoothrotate` - When on outputs a smooth rotation curve without graphical jumps at 0, 90, etc.

Channel Names `nameformat` - ⊞ - Sets how the created channels are named.

* Channel Name `channel` - Automatically names channels. **For example**: `tx, ty, tz`.

* Target and Channel Names `target` - Names channels with target prefix. **For example**: if target = `obj1`, then `obj1:tx, obj1:ty, obj1:tz`.

* Reference and Channel Names `reference` - Names channels with reference parameter prefix. Behaves like Target and Channel Names above but uses the name of the reference object.

Output Range `outputrange` - ⊞ - The start and end time of the desired interval of the object path.

* Current Frame `currentframe` - Output a single sample at the current frame.

* Current Time Slice `timeslice` - Span of samples covering the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)").

* Start / End `startend` - Uses range defined by the Start / End parameters below.

Cook Past Values (slow) `cookpast` - If the project has skipped one or more frames, this will attempt to cook it's inputs at multiple previous frames to avoid discontinuities in it's calculations.
Start `start` - The start time of the desired interval of the object path.
Start Unit `startunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

Object COMP Xform Page - Derivative

# Object COMP Xform Page

## Parameters - Xform Page[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Object_COMP_Xform_Page&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Parameters - Xform Page")]

Transform Order `xord` - The menu attached to this parameter allows you to specify the order in which the changes to your Component will take place. Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as `translate * rotate * scale * vectorOrPosition`.

Translate / Rotation / Scale `t[xyz] r[xyz] s[xyz]` - The three fields allow you to specify the amount of movement along any of the three axes; the amount, in degrees, of rotation around any of the three axes; and a non-uniform scaling along the three axes. As an alternative to entering the values directly into these fields, you can modify the values by manipulating the Component in the Viewport with the Select & Transform state.

Uniform Scale `scale` - This field allows you to change the size of an Component uniformly along the three axes.

**Note:** Scaling a camera's channels is not generally recommended. However, should you decide to do so, the rendered output will match the Viewport as closely as possible when scales are involved.

Constrain To `constrain` - Allows the location of the object to be constrained to any other object whose path is specified in this parameter.

Look At `lookat` - Allows you to orient your Component by naming the Component you would like it to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this Component to look at, it will continue to face that Component, even if you move it. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another Component's movements. The Look At parameter points the Component in question at the other Component's origin.

**Tip:** To designate a center of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null Component and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null Component, and tell the camera to look at this Component using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null Component with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null Component, enable the Null Component's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.

Look At Up Vector `lookup` - When specifying a Look At, it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat Component passes through the Y axis of the target Component.

Path SOP `pathsop` - Names the SOP that functions as the path you want this Component to move along. For instance, you can name an SOP that provides a spline path for the camera to follow.

Production Tip: For Smooth Motion Along a Path - Having a Component follow an animation path is simple. However, when using a NURBS curve as your path, you might notice that the Component speeds up and slows down unexpectedly as it travels along the path. This is usually because the CVs are spaced unevenly. In such a case, use the [Resample SOP](Resample_SOP.html "Resample SOP") to redistribute the CVs so that they are evenly spaced along the curve. A caution however - using a Resample SOP can be slow if you have an animating path curve.

An alternative method is to append a [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html "Basis SOP") to the path curve and change it to a `Uniform Curve`. This way, your Component will move uniformly down the curve, and there is no need for the Resample SOP and the unnecessary points it generates.

Roll `roll` - Using the angle control you can specify a Component's rotation as it animates along the path.

Position `pos` - This parameter lets you specify the Position of the Component along the path. The values you can enter for this parameter range from `0` to `1`, where `0` equals the starting point and `1` equals the end point of the path. The value slider allows for values as high as `10` for multiple "passes" along the path.

Orient Along Path `pathorient` - If this option is selected, the Component will be oriented along the path. The positive Z axis of the Component will be pointing down the path.

Up Vector `up` - When orienting a Component, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.

Oculus Rift CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Oculus Rift CHOP

The Oculus Rift CHOP connects to an [Oculus Rift](Oculus_Rift.html "Oculus Rift") device and outputs several useful sets of channels that can be used to integrate the Oculus Rift into projects.

You can view the detected orientation of the device and put the rotation values directly into other operators. To help decrease latency, prediction can be used to guess what the orientation will be at some point in the future.

The raw sensor data is also available, with options for both sensor acceleration and angular velocity.

The devices calibration parameters are another option. These can be used to generate the projection matrices and distortion shaders, although both of these are already available (see below and [Oculus Rift TOP](Oculus_Rift_TOP.html "Oculus Rift TOP")). This data is constant, but may differ on future devices.

The last two things the Oculus Rift CHOP can output are the left and right eye projection matrices. These can be (and will need to be) passed into a camera's "Custom Projection" parameter in order to provide a proper 3D experience with the Oculus Rift. For convenience, the channels are aligned to be passed in directly by reference.

Without an Oculus Rift device connected the CHOP uses default values and will output channels corresponding to the Oculus Rift Developer Kit device. This allows you to design something for the Oculus Rift without actually having one.

OP Find DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OP Find DAT

The OP Find DAT traverses the component hierarchy starting at one component and looking at all nodes within that component, and outputs a table with one row per node that matches criteria the user chooses. For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with “`wave`”, or all nodes with the Clone parameter set to “`master1`”, or all Geometry components with a tag called “`emitter`”.

The criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a DAT containing certain strings.

You can also cause the DAT to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.

Criteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find DAT.

Furthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback DAT.

With the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an "or" or "and" on the pattern matching criterea.

It also takes an optional DAT containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find DAT) which can be used to chain filters.

### Output Columns

There is a variety of columns that you can select from including `name`, `id`, `paths`, `type` and `tags`. (`id` is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)

You can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback DAT, and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback DAT. For example, you can output a custom column which is the `tx` parameter value of the node.

You can control when the OP Find DAT cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active Cook menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely. You can also click the Pulse parameter on Active Cook in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.

Instead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find DAT can take an input DAT containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input DAT should contain the node “id” as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find DAT with the Column called “ID” turned on.

For example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or Clone parameter. The first OP Find DAT pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.

OpenColorIO TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OpenColorIO TOP

The OpenColorIO TOP utilizes the OpenColorIO library (<http://opencolorio.org/>) to apply various transforms and lookup tables to your textures and images. The default order that the transforms are applied is: Color Space, File, CDL, Output (Display).

This order can be changed using multiple OpenColorIO TOPs in a chain, with any unnecessary transforms toggled off.

The color space of TouchDesigner TOPs is linear, so generally, images inported to TouchDesigner have to be converted to linear, if they are non-linearly encoded.

# OpenVR CHOP

The OpenVR CHOP receives positional data, frame rendering info, and action data from the [OpenVR](OpenVR.html "OpenVR") SDK. Each CHOP can output in one of 5 modes: Sensors, Projection Matrices, Trackers, Frame Timings, Actions and Skeletons.

### Actions

Actions are described in more details in [OpenVR Actions](https://docs.derivative.ca/OpenVR_Actions "OpenVR Actions").

### Getting Sensor Data at Higher Rates

By default when running a VR system the file will be throttled to the speed of the VR devices refresh rate by the OpenVR SDK. This helps ensure the low latency output required for a good VR experience. If only controllers/Vive trackers are being used for tracking in a non-VR situation, the file can run and sample those devices at a higher sample rate as long as no [OpenVR TOP](OpenVR_TOP.html "OpenVR TOP") in the project. If an [OpenVR TOP](OpenVR_TOP.html "OpenVR TOP") is present anywhere in the project, then playback will be throttled to the VR devices refresh rate.

Optical Flow TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Optical Flow TOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Microsoft Windows** operating system.  
**Hardware:** This operator currently only works with **Nvidia GPUs** of the 3000 series or higher.

Optical Flow detects patterns of motion in its input. The motion detected in the X-direction is output in the red (R) channel, while the motion in the Y-direction is output in the green (G) channel.

The pixel values stored in the red and green channels are 32-bit floating point numbers. A value of 1.0 in a pixel of the red channel means that the horizontal motion of what is at that part of the image is moving left-to-right at 1 screen-width per second. In a 16x9 image, a green value of 1.0 at that pixel means the motion is upward at 1 screen-width per second, or 1 \* 16/9 = 1.77 times the screen height per second.

The values can be scaled with the Gain parameters. The TOP can drive forces in the particlesGpu component.

  + [5.1 Common TOP Info Channels](#Common_TOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Optical Flow Page

Grid Size `gridsize` - ⊞ - Determines the output resolution. A smaller grid corresponds to a larger output image. [Turing GPUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(microarchitecture)) only support `4x4`, whereas newer GPUs can use any option.

* 1x1 `grid1x1` - The smallest grid size, which is slowest to compute. The output resolution is the same as the input resolution.

* 2x2 `grid2x2` - The output resolution is half of the input resolution.

* 4x4 `grid4x4` - The largest grid size, which is the fastest to compute. The output resolution is one quarter of the input resolution.

Quality `quality` - ⊞ - Specify the optical flow model. Higher quality is slower to compute, and low quality is faster to compute.

* High `high` - High quality optical flow, but slow to compute.

* Medium `medium` - Medium quality optical flow, with medium computational speed.

* Low `low` - Low quality optical flow, but fast to compute.

Cost Output `costoutput` - Toggle whether the "cost" of the optical flow is output in the blue channel of the TOP. Higher cost means higher uncertainty in the optical flow estimate in the RG channels. The cost values are integers between 0 and 255.
Gain `gain` - ⊞ - A post-multiply for the optical flow in the RG channels, allowing control of output intensity.

* Gain `gainx` - This number will be multiplied by the R channel (the optical flow in the x-direction) at the very end.

* Gain `gainy` - This number will be multiplied by the G channel (the optical flow in the y-direction) at the very end.

Manual Timing `manualtiming` - The Optical Flow TOP works in both real-time mode and non-real-time mode. However, if you have a video source whose frame rate differs from the project rate, you might be able to get better optical flow results with Manual Timing enabled. For every input video frame, you would need a timestamp in seconds to drive the `timestamp` parameter on the TOP. Some TOPs related to video streaming have this `timestamp` channel when an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") is placed on them.
Timestamp `timestamp` - This is a timestamp in seconds of the video frame. See the discussion of Manual Timing in the parameter above.

Extra Information for the Optical Flow TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Orbbec TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Orbbec TOP

The Orbbec TOP can be used to retrieve video streams and IMU data from an [Orbbec camera](Orbbec.html "Orbbec"). The available video streams depend on the connected camera, but typically include color, depth, IR and point cloud data. This node uses the Orbbec SDK and a list of [compatible camera models](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) can be found on the project's Github page.

The camera may be connected either by USB or ethernet depending on the model. USB cameras will appear automatically in the Device list, but you must enter the correct IP address to connect to a camera via ethernet.

**Note:** Obtaining color video images over ethernet is not currently supported.

**MacOS:** Connecting to Orbbec cameras on Mac OS systems requires root privileges. You can launch TouchDesigner with root privileges by opening a Terminal window and using the sudo command i.e. `sudo "/Applications/TouchDesigner.app/contents/MacOS/TouchDesigner"`

To obtain more than one video stream from a camera, you can use one or more [Orbbec Select TOPs](Orbbec_Select_TOP.html "Orbbec Select TOP") linked to the primary Orbbec TOP. All resolution and configuration is handled by the primary Orbbec TOP.

Skeleton tracking data can also be obtained from compatible Kinect Orbbec cameras (Femto Mega, Femto Bolt, etc) using the [Kinect Azure TOP](Kinect_Azure_TOP.html "Kinect Azure TOP") and [Kinect Azure CHOP](Kinect_Azure_CHOP.html "Kinect Azure CHOP"). **Note:** if using the Kinect Azure nodes with Orbbec hardware, you should not use the Orbbec TOP in the same project or it could lead to instabilities.

OSC In can be used to accept messages from either a 3rd party application which adheres to the Open Sound Control specification (<http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/>). OSC In is based on a connection-less system, meaning that it can accept multiple messages for any number of sources at the same time. The user must specify a port number which OSC In will look for incoming messages. This port must not have anything running on it before OSC In attempts to use it. OSC CHOPs in TouchDesigner use the UDP transport protocol.

See also [OSC In DAT](OSC_In_DAT.html "OSC In DAT"), [OSC Out CHOP](OSC_Out_CHOP.html "OSC Out CHOP"), [iOS and OSC](IOS_and_OSC.html "IOS and OSC"), [Touch In CHOP](Touch_In_CHOP.html "Touch In CHOP").

There are options which allow the user to adjust the default message queuing system to optimize it for their specific network conditions and usage needs. The Min/Max Target size specifies a range which the queue attempts to keep the buffer size at in seconds. Increasing the Queue Adjust Time will determine how long the queue can be outside that range before it tries to correct it.

If the user wishes to use OSC In to detect when messages are arriving, there is a Pulse Mode toggle which will read a single sample of any incoming message when it arrives and displays the pulse reset values any other time. This is useful for syncing beats between TouchDesigner and another applications.

Network Address `netaddress` - When using Multicast, this is the address that OSC In will listen for packets on.
Network Port `port` - The port which OSC-In will accept packets on.
Local Address `localaddress` - Specify an IP address to receive on, useful when the system has mulitple NICs (Network Interface Card) and you want to select which one to use.
OSC Address Scope `oscaddressscope` - To reduce which channels are generated, you can use channel name patterns to include or exclude channels. For example, `^*accel*` will exclude accelerometer channels coming in from an iPhone or iOS app like mrmr. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") for the syntax of the possible channel name patterns.
Use Global Rate `useglobalrate` - When on, the CHOP will sample at the *global* sample rate specified by TouchDesigner.
Default Sample Rate `samplerate` - When Use Global Rate is off, this parameter is used to determine the sample rate of this CHOP.
Queued `queued` - Turn this on to enable queuing to help avoid lost messages. Use the parameters below to setup the queue behavior.
Queue Variance `queuevariance` - The range around the Queue Target that's acceptable. If the queue's length is within the target and variance range, the CHOP will not bother to adjust the queue length.
Queue Variance Unit `queuevarianceunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Maximum Queue `maxqueue` - The maximum size of the queue when full. Incoming samples will be dropped if the maximum queue is reached.
Max Queue Unit `maxqueueunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Queue Adjust Time `adjusttime` - Specifies how often to repeat/drop a samples in order to get closer to the queue target range. If the value = 1 and the units = seconds, then it will try to repeat/drop a sample once per second to maintain the queue target set in the Minimum Target and Maximum Target parameters above.
Adjust Unit `adjusttimeunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Strip Prefix Segments `stripsegments` - Strip a number of prefixes from the incoming address. Example: An address of /a/b/c/d/e with 3 segments removed would show d/e (or d\_e as a final channel name).
Reset Channels `resetchannels` - Deletes all channels when set to On, new channels will not be added until Reset Channels is turned Off.
Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse` - Instantly deletes all channels.
Reset Values `resetvalues` - Resets all channel values to 0 when On, channel values will not be updated until Reset Values is turned Off.
Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse` - Instantly resets all channels to 0.

# OSC In DAT

The OSC In DAT receives and parses full Open Sound Control packets using UDP by default. Each packet is parsed and appended as a row in the DAT's table. The table is FIFO "fisrt-in first-out" and limited to parameter-set number of lines. An optional script may be run for each packet received. Each packet/row represents either one OSC message, or an entire OSC bundle. Each argument is translated into readable ASCII text.

OSC Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OSC Out CHOP

TheOSC Out CHOP sends all input channels to a specified network address and port. Each channel name and associated data is transmitted together to the specified location. TouchDesigner time stamps all outgoing Open Sound Control messages with the time of the outgoing frame relative to the system time when the first message was sent. OSC CHOPs in TouchDesigner use the UDP transport protocol.

OSC Out will either send all the channels each cook or it will only send each channel depending on if it has changed at all since the last time it was sent. This is determined by the Send Events Every Cook flag.

OSC bundles allows you to send a group of messages in a single command rather than as separate, individual messages. The [OSC Out DAT](OSC_Out_DAT.html "OSC Out DAT") has a `sendOSC()` function that will accept a list of messages and send as a bundle.

OSC Out DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# OSC Out DAT

The OSC Out DAT is used for sending information over a OSC connection between remotely located computers. Use the [`.sendOSC()`](https://docs.derivative.ca/OscoutDAT_Class "OscoutDAT Class") python method to output the OSC messages.

OSC bundles allows you to send a group of messages in a single command rather than as separate, individual messages. The OSC Out DAT `sendOSC()` function will accept a list of messages and send as a bundle when you set the kwarg `asBundle=True`.
Bundles were created as a performance optimization for real-time control of synthesizers with a large number of parameters. (thx Jesse Gilbert)

Ouster TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Ouster TOP

[Ouster](https://docs.derivative.ca/Ouster "Ouster") makes LIDAR devices for scanning 3D environments. The Ouster TOP sends and receives data with an Ouster Imaging Lidar, converting to point cloud data on the GPU. For more information see the user guides at [Ouster.io](https://www.ouster.io/resources)

**Requirements:**

* The TOP currently supports Ouster devices using version 2.x firmware. Devices that require version 3 firmware are not currently supported.
* Access to your local network to connect with the sensor device. Check your firewall settings if you have trouble accessing the device.
* High resolution scanning modes require up to 130Mbps of bandwidth. Gigabit Ethernet hardware is required for full operation. Insufficient bandwidth will cause broken images and missing frames.

**Features include:**

* Additional sensor data like IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit - the gyroscope and accelerometer), packet counts, matrices via Info CHOP and Info DAT.
* Visual Panoramic and Scan Order capture formats selectable in 'Image Layout' parameter.
* Flexible X, Y, Z, Range, Intensity and Noise plane mapping to RGBA GPU Image Channels
* Time Sync Mode for supporting multiple devices in the same area (Internal OSC, Sync Pulse In, PTP 1588)
* Auto startup features

**Connection Instructions:**

To connect to the sensor, you will need either the IP addressed assigned by the local DHCP server or the name of the device. The name is based on the serial number that is usually printed on the top of the sensor in the format "os-############". This name can be entered directly into the Device Address parameter (see parameter help below). You can also connect to the device through a web browser using the IP or name in the format `[http://os-###########/](http://os-/###########/)`. The web interface allows you to check the status of the device and gives additional error information.

Once the device is configured, it will continue to send output to the target IP address so it is not required to enter the device address again unless you need to change the configuration.

Range data collected from the device is presented as 32bit floating point values in the RGBA channels of the output image. Output can be arranged either in chronological scan order or as a panoramic image using the Image Layout parameter. IMU data from the device can be accessed by connecting an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP"). If more than 4 output channels are needed, you can use a [Ouster Select TOP](Ouster_Select_TOP.html "Ouster Select TOP") to create additional output images.

**Note:** All 3D coordinates are transformed into TouchDesigner space where Y is up and X and Z represent the ground plane. This is different from the original coordinate space defined in the Ouster documentation.

The lookup tables used to convert the range values into 3D points can be accessed with an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT").

## Parameters - Connection Page

Active `active` - Enables connections with the device.
Device Address `deviceaddress` - The IP address or the name of the Ouster device. The address is only required during configuraton. The device will request an address from the local DHCP server when it is connected to the network. The name of the device is printed on the top of the sensor in the format "os-#####", where ##### is the serial number e.g. "os-991900123456". You can determine the IP address using the ping command and the device name e.g. ping -4 os-991900123456. For more information see the Ouster User Guide at [Ouster.io](https://www.ouster.io/downloads).
Lidar Port `lidarport` - The UDP port number to receive lidar data.
IMU Port `imuport` - The UDP port number to receive data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the device. The IMU data can be accessed by connecting the Ouster TOP to an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").
Command Port `commandport` - The TCP/IP port number to use to send configuration commands to the device.
Target Address `targetaddress` - The IP address where the sensor should send the lidar and IMU data to. If the parameter is blank, the address of the current machine will be used. This field should only be necessary if the sending machine has more than one IP address or if you wish to send the lidar data to a different machine than the one you are configuring it on.
Local Address `localaddress` - An IP address for the current machine that should be used to connect to the device with. If the address is left blank, the default network address will be used.
Scan Mode `scanmode` - ⊞ - Select a scanning mode to set the sensor's horizontal resolution and number of revolutions per second. The vertical resolution is determined by the hardware e.g. an OS1-64 sensor has vertical resolution of 64 pixels (samples).

* 512 x 10Hz `mode512x10` -

* 512 x 20Hz `mode512x20` -

Configure Device `configdevice` - Enable this toggle to have the Ouster TOP set the configuration properties of the device. If the device has already been configured to the correct mode and network connections than this can be disabled to save some processing time.

The Output page allows you to select what data is placed in the TOP's output image. Range, Intensity, Reflectivity and Noise are raw data channels coming from the sensor, while XYZ position values are calculated by using the range data and the look up table of beam azimuth and altitude angles. Range is measured in millimeters, while XYZ positions are in meters. If you need more than 4 channels of data, use a [Ouster Select TOP](Ouster_Select_TOP.html "Ouster Select TOP") to create a second output image from the same sensor data.

In addition to the sensor data, you can also assign a constant value of one or zero to a channel by selecting the corresponding entry from the menu. Selecting 'Active Mask' from the channel menu will output a one if the pixel represents valid sensor data or a zero if it is padding (when the image contains more pixels than there is available sensor data). The mask channel can be used in the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") Active instance channel to control which points are used for instancing.

* Output Sync Pulse In `outputsyncpulsein` -

* Output PTP 1588 `outputptp1588` -

* Output Encoder Angle `outputangle` - Signal output is based on the angle of the encoder.

Sync Pulse Out Polarity `pulseoutpolarity` - ⊞ - Polarity of the output signal pulse.

Sync Pulse Out Frequency `pulseoutfrequency` - Frequency of the output pulse in Hz (must be greater than 0).
Sync Pulse Out Angle `pulseoutangle` - The encoder angle at which to output a signal pulse. Measured in degrees less than 360.
Sync Pulse Out Width `pulseoutwidth` - Width of the output signal pulse in mm.
NMEA In Polarity `nmeainpolarity` - ⊞ - Sets the polarity of the NMEA URT input $GPRMC messages. Set to 'Active High' if UART is active high, idle low, and the start bit is after a falling edge.

NMEA Ignore Valid Char `nmeaignorevalidchar` - Turn off, if the NMEA UART input $GPRMC messages should be ignored if valid character is not set, and turn on if messages should be used for time syncing regardless of the valid character.
NMEA Baud Rate `nmeabaudrate` - ⊞ - The baud rate for the incoming NMEA URT input $GPRMC messages.

* Baud 9600 `baud9600` -

Override CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Override CHOP

The Override CHOP lets you take inputs from several CHOP sources, and uses the most-recently changed input channels to determine the output. For example, if a 16-channel CHOP comes from one MIDI device, and another 16-channel CHOP comes from another place like another device or a preset, then Override selects the most recently-changed channels and outputs those values.

The Override CHOP outputs the same channels as the first input. If subsequent inputs have more or less channels than the first input, the missing/extra channels are ignored. The output defaults to the channel values of the first input, but when a value changes in any monitored channel, that value will become the new output for the corresponding channel name or number. If the same channel name or number is changing in two or more inputs at the same time, precedence is given by input order.

The Override CHOP output is reset to the default each time the number of inputs to the CHOP changes or the method of matching (by number or by name) changes.

The CHOP length is the length of the first input. From frame to frame, if all values are the same, the output is unchanged.

An optional channel can be created that will tell you which input has the most recently changed channel.

Pack TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Pack TOP

The Pack TOP can be used to pack 32-bit floating point values into a larger 8-bit texture, so it can saved in a lossless format such as .tiff or Animation codec. The Pack TOP can then later be used to unpack these values back to 32-bit floats. This is useful for things such as point cloud data from the [Kinect TOP](Kinect_TOP.html "Kinect TOP"), or [RealSense TOP](RealSense_TOP.html "RealSense TOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[packTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PackTOP_Class "PackTOP Class")

## Parameters - Pack Page

Pack Type `packtype` - ⊞ - Controls the direction and behavior of the packing/unpacking.

* Pack `pack` - Will take the input texture, treat all of the channels as 32-bit floats (even if they are not), and pack those into an 8-bit fixed point texture. The width of the resulting texture will be NumberOfChannelsInInputTexture \* InputWidth. This is because each channel on the input will turn into one 8-bit RGBA pixel on output. The height will remain the same. This operation will work on any input pixel format.

* Unpack R `unpackr` - Treats the input texture as if it only has information for the Red channel, and converts each 8-bit RGBA pixels into a single 32-bit float Red channel pixel.

* Unpack RG `unpackrg` - Like Unpack R, but treats the pixels as alternating RGRGRG etc, and turns them into 32-bit float RG pixels.

* Unpack RGB `unpackrgb` - Like Unpack RG, but treats the pixels as alternating RGBRGBRGB etc, and turns them into 32-bit float RGB pixels.

* Unpack RGBA `unpackrgbA` - Like Unpack RGB, but treats the pixels as alternating RGBARGBARGBA etc, and turns them into 32-bit float RGBA pixels.

Extra Information for the Pack TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Page Class - Derivative

# Page Class

The Page Class describes the list of custom [parameters](Par_Class.html "Par Class") contained on a page. Pages are created on components via the COMP Class. See also the guide [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters").

Methods that create parameters return a [ParGroup](ParGroup_Class.html "ParGroup Class") that was created.

To view individual attributes of each parameter such as default, min, max, etc, see the [Par Class](Par_Class.html "Par Class") documentation.

Pages can be accessed like a Python list of parameters:

```
page = op('button1').pages[0]	# get the page object
print(len(page))				# number of parameters on the page 
debug(page[0])					# first parameter on the page
for p in pages:

The Panel CHOP reads [Panel Values](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value") from [Panel Components](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") into CHOP channels. Panel values can also be accessed by using the `panel` Member of the [PanelCOMP Class](PanelCOMP_Class.html "PanelCOMP Class").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[panelCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PanelCHOP_Class "PanelCHOP Class")

Component `component` - The path of the Component being referenced.
Select `select` - Specify which panel values to create channels for. Use \* to select all panel values. Add individual values using the drop down menu on the right.
Rename `rename` - Rename the panel value channels selected with the Select parameter here. For example, if "u v" are selected in the Select parameter, you can rename these channels to horizontal and vertical by entering "horizontal vertical".
Queue Overlapping Events `queue` - Queue all events that occur in a [time slice](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing"). Some [panel values](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value"), such as wheel or key, switches between a value and 0 in the same time slice and are considered instantaneous. When this parameter is off, only the last value in the time slice will be used, and changes could be missed. Turning this on will keep as many events as possible based on queue size. Each queued item will be released in the next time slice until the queue is empty, and value changes within the same time slice are synchronized.
Queue Size `queuesize` - Size of queue. If the number of events is larger than the queue size, earlier events will be discarded.

Extra Information for the Panel CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Panel Execute DAT

The Panel Execute DAT will run its script when the [Panel Values](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value") of a specified panel component changes. You can specify which panel values to monitor, and trigger scripts based on their values changing in various ways.

Panel Execute DATs are created with [default python method](https://docs.derivative.ca/PanelexecuteDAT_Class "PanelexecuteDAT Class") placeholders. For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

In the template Python script, `panelValue` is passed to each method, and you can query each call by printing `panelValue.name` and `panelValue.val`. See [PanelValue Class](PanelValue_Class.html "PanelValue Class").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[panelexecuteDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PanelexecuteDAT_Class "PanelexecuteDAT Class")

## Parameters - Panel Execute Page

From Operator `fromop` - The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to *Specified Operator*.
Panels `panels` - Select which [Panel COMPs](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") to monitor for changes.
Panel Value `panelvalue` - The [Panel Value](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value")(s) that is monitored to trigger the execution of the script.

Scripts will execute based on a combination of the five trigger events listed below. The script is executed once per trigger (except for While On/While Off cases). Each event will only cause one trigger to go off (i.e. if both Off to On and On Value Change are checked, one event will be fired with Off to On as the trigger). Logic for the 'on' state is *greater than zero*.

Off to On `offtoon` - The onOffToOn() method executes when the panel value specified switches from off to on, called at the first "on" frame.

PanelValue Class - Derivative

# PanelValue Class

A PanelValue describes an instance to a [Panel Value](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value"). They can be accessed through a component's [panel](Panel.html "Panel") member, and are used in the [Panel Execute DAT](Panel_Execute_DAT.html "Panel Execute DAT").

> The name of the panel value. See [Panel Value](Panel_Value.html "Panel Value") for the list of possible names. name is a string.

> Get or set the panel value.

The PanelValue Class implements all necessary methods to be treated as a number or string, which in this case gets or sets its value. Therefore, an explicit call to eval() or set() is unnecessary when used in a parameter, or in a numeric expression.
For example, the following are equivalent in a parameter:

```
(float)parent().panel.u
parent().panel.u.val
parent().panel.u

# the following are also equivalent
parent().panel.u.val + 1
parent().panel.u + 1

# as are the following
parent().panel.u.val = 0.5
parent().panel.u = 0.5

Pangolin CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Pangolin CHOP

The Pangolin CHOP interfaces with Pangolin's [Beyond](https://pangolin.com/collections/beyond-software). Beyond is a professional laser and multimedia show control application. When Beyond is running, the Pangolin CHOP will send laser image frames to it. The image frames are created from either a SOP input or CHOP input.

The Pangolin CHOP should work with any version of Beyond but it is recommended to use at least Beyond v5.1.

**TouchDesigner Non-commercial will only work with the demo version of Beyond. TouchDesigner Commercial or Pro is required to interface with licensed versions of Beyond.**

Sending CHOP channels to Pangolin: Input channels are determined by name: `x`, `y`, `z`, `r`, `g`, `b`, `id`. Only the `x`, and `y` channels are required. Every sample will be interpreted as a point to be drawn. Points can be grouped together into a single shape using the `id` channel.

See also: [Laser CHOP](Laser_CHOP.html "Laser CHOP").

  + [5.2 Common CHOP Info Channels](#Common_CHOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.3 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Beyond must be open to use the Pangolin CHOP.

The Pangolin CHOP will construct a laser image from the points of a SOP or samples of a CHOP and send it to Beyond. With Beyond open and the Pangolin CHOP active (with input) the laser image can immediately be seen in its respective zone in the zone viewer of Beyond. See below an example of sending a circle to zone 1 in Beyond from the Pangolin CHOP.

[![PangolinTDZone.PNG](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/1/1e/PangolinTDZone.PNG)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:PangolinTDZone.PNG)

## Parameters - Pangolin Page

Active `active` - When disabled, the CHOP will no longer send to Beyond. The corresponding image in Beyond will also be cleared.
Source `source` - ⊞ - Select the source operator.

* SOP `sop` - Use a SOP as the source. Apart from position attributes, the SOP's point color attributes are used to determine the color output.

* CHOP `chop` - Use a CHOP as the source. Input channels are determined by name: `x`, `y`, `z`, `r`, `g`, `b`, `id`. Only the `x`, and `y` channels are required. Every sample will be interpreted as a point to be drawn. Points can be grouped together into a single shape using the `id` channel.

SOP `sop` - Path to the SOP.
CHOP `chop` - Path to the CHOP. The input CHOP must have **x**, **y** channels for the point positions. In addition, it also supports **z**, **r**, **g**, **b**, and **id** channels. The **id** channel is used for grouping points together as a single shape. By default when no **id** channel is present, each point is separate and unconnected.
Zone `zone` - The index of the zone to send to in Beyond.
Rate Mode `ratemode` - ⊞ - Select the mode for calculating the rate of the image in Beyond. Note: this is not the rate of the CHOP.

* Percent of Projector Sample Rate `percent` - Rate will be calculated as a percent of the default projector sample rate. Specify the percent using the Percent parameter.

* Sample Rate `sample` - Specify the sample rate.

Percent `percent` - Specify the sample rate as a percent of the projector default sample rate.
Sample Rate `rate` - Specify the sample rate of the image in Beyond
Vertex Repeat `repeat` - How often to repeat each point in the image (not including blanked points).
Vector Frame `vector` - When enabled, the image will be sent to Beyond as a vector frame. A vector frame will have extra computation done in Beyond, such as the addition of blanking points. When disabled, the image will be sent as points to the DAC, with nothing extra added.
Resend Image `resend` - Resend the image to Beyond.
Enable Laser Output `enableout` - Enables laser output in Beyond. Has the same effect as hitting the "Enable Laser Output" button in Beyond.
Disable Laser Output `disableout` - Disables laser output in Beyond. Has the same effect as hitting the "Disable Laser Output" button in Beyond.
Blackout `blackout` - Sends a blackout command to Beyond. Has the effect as hitting the "Blackout" button in Beyond.

`collapsable` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns True if the parameter is collapsable.

### Menu Parameters[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Menu Parameters")]

Menu parameters can be get or set by specifying either the string value of the menu, or its numeric index. For example, the following are equivalent:

```
op('geo1').par.xord = 'trs'
op('geo1').par.xord = 5

Alternatively, the menu can be accessed more directly:

```
n = op('geo1')
n.par.xord.menuIndex = 5  #trs
a = n.menuNames[0]  #returns 'srt'
b = n.menuLabels[0] #returns 'Scale Rotate Translate'

`copy(Par)`→ `None`:

> Copy the specified parameter.
> 
> * Par - The parameter to copy.
> 
> ```
> op('geo1').par.tx.copy( op('geo2').par.tx )
> 
> ```

`eval()`→ `Any`:

> Evaluate a parameter. This value may be derived by the parameter's constant value, expression, export, or bind, dependent on its mode.
> 
> ```
> a = op('geo1').par.tx.eval()
> 
> ```
> 
> Calling `eval` on an OP parameter that can hold multiple OPs will return a single OP if there is only 1 result, a list of OPs if there are more than 1, and None if there are no results.

`evalNorm()`→ `float`:

> Similar to eval() but the returns the normalized slider value.

`evalExpression()`→ `Any`:

> Evaluate the expression portion of a parameter, if it contains one. This will ignore any exports, etc.
> 
> ```
> a = op('geo1').par.tx.evalExpression()
> 
> ```
> 
> **Note**: the results of evalExpression is always the expression's Python return value, which can be slightly different than `Par.eval()`. For example, in parameters that hold an operator, `.eval()` will always return an operator if it exists, even if the expression actually returns a string path. The evalExpression function would return the string path.
> 
> To evaluate an arbitrary expression string, that is not inside a parameter, see [OP](OP_Class.html "OP Class").evalExpression.

`evalExport()`→ `Any`:

> Evaluate the export portion of a parameter, if it contains one. This will ignore any expressions, etc.
> 
> ```
> a = op('geo1').par.tx.evalExport()
> 
> ```

`evalOPs()`→ `List[OP]`:

> Evaluate the parameter as series of operators. This is useful for a custom parameter that specifies a list of operator paths for example.
> 
> ```
> a = op('base1').par.Paths.evalOPs()
> 
> ```

`evalFile()`→ `tdu.FileInfo`:

> Evaluate the parameter as a file path. This returns a [FileInfo](Tdu_Module.html "Tdu Module") object with the full path.
> 
> ```
> a = op('moviefilein1').par.file.evalFile()
> print(a.ext)
> print(a.baseName)
> print(a.exists)
> 
> ```

`pulse(value=1, frames=0, seconds=0)`→ `None`:

> Pulsing sets a parameter to the specific value, cooks the operator, then restores the parameter to its previous value.
> 
> For pulse type parameters no value or time is specified or used.
> 
> * value - (Optional) The value to pulse this parameter with, default is 1.
> * frames - (Optional) Number of frames before restoring the parameter to its original value.
> * seconds - (Optional) Number of seconds before restoring the parameter to its original value.
> 
> ```
> op('moviein1').par.reload.pulse(1) #set the reload toggle, then cook
> op('glsl1').par.loadvariablenames.pulse() #activate the pulse parameter
> op('geo1').par.ty.pulse(2, frames=120) #pulse geometry ty for 120 frames
> op('text1').par.text.pulse('GO!', seconds=3) #pulse text TOP string field, for 3 seconds
> op('noise').par.type.pulse('random', seconds=0.5) #pulse noise meny type for half a second
> 
> ```

> Destroy the parameter referenced by this Par. An exception will be raised if the parameter has already been destroyed. Only custom and sequential parameters can be destroyed. Destroying a sequential parameter will destroy its entire block. Note: When any parameter is destroyed, any existing parameter objects will be invalid and should be re-fetched.

`reset()`→ `bool`:

> Resets the parameter to its default state.
> 
> Returns true if anything was changed.
> 
> ```
> op('geo1').par.tx.reset()
> 
> ```

`isPar(par : Par)`→ `bool`:

> True if the provided Par is the same parameter on the same operator. Because `op('container1').par.x == op('container2').par.x` compares values and `op('container1').par.x is op('container1').par.x` is always False (because of TouchDesigner internals), you must use `isPar` to compare parameter objects.
> 
> * par - The parameter to compare identity with.

The Par Class implements all necessary methods to be treated as a number or string, which in this case gets or sets its value. Therefore, an explicit call to `eval()` or `set()` is unnecessary when used in a parameter, or in a numeric expression.

For example, the following are equivalent in a parameter:

* `(float)me.par.tx`
* `me.par.tx.eval()`
* `me.par.tx`

The following are also equivalent:

* `me.par.tx.eval() + 1`
* `me.par.tx + 1`

As are the following:

* `me.par.tx.val = 3`
* `me.par.tx = 3`

**Note:** However, you can't use functions belonging to the cast object type without evaluating the parameter:

* `me.par.tx.hex() # doesn't work`
* `me.par.tx.eval().hex() # works!`

(This replaces the Fetch CHOP.)

Retrieve from parameters alternatively using a `node.par.Customname` expression of the [Par Class](Par_Class.html "Par Class"), or the [Parameter Execute DAT](Parameter_Execute_DAT.html "Parameter Execute DAT").

See the [Select CHOP](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP") for retrieving channels from the output of other CHOPs.

Parameter COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Parameter COMP

The Parameter Component allows any operator's parameter dialog to be a panel with full interactivity. You specify which operator whose parameters you want to appear in the panel.

You can optionally have it display the header and the page names, and include built-in or [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters").

You can specify a scope of pages and individual parameters to display, for example two entire pages plus four parameters on other pages. When specifying parameters only, the order of the parameters is the order you specify them in.

You can shrink the UI so it fits into a smaller panel, using the Compress parameter.

You can control whether users can open the parameter for editing (via the + on the left of the parameter) using the Allow Expansion toggle. You can prevent users from going in and editing expressions.

You can specify page or parameter names using pattern matching: `scale*` `^tx`, etc, with page names that contain spaces specified in quotes. `'Cue 1' 'Cue 2'`, or specified as a python list.

# Parameter Execute DAT

The Parameter Execute DAT runs a script when a [parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter") of any operator changes state. There are 4 ways a parameter can trigger the script: if its value, expression, export, or enable state changes.

Parameter Execute DATs are created with [default python method placeholders](https://docs.derivative.ca/ParameterexecuteDAT_Class#Callbacks "ParameterexecuteDAT Class"). Unlike other execute DATs, the Parameter Execute DAT does not cook the node that it is watching, to avoid issues with recursive updates.

## Parameters - Parameter Execute Page

Active `active` - While on, the DAT will respond to the Parameter that is referenced.
Execute from `executeloc` - ⊞ - ([Tscript](Operator_Language.html "Operator Language") only) Determines the location the script is run from.

From Operator `fromop` - This operator is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to *Specified Operator*.
OPs `op` - Specify which operator(s) the triggering parameter belongs to.
Parameters `pars` - Specify which parameter(s) to monitor for triggering the script.
Value Change `valuechange` - The onValueChange() method executes when the parameter value specified changes value in any way. It is called once each frame.
Values Changed `valueschanged` - The onValuesChanged() method executes at end of frame with complete list of individual parameter changes. The changes are a list of named tuples, where each tuple is (Par, previous value)
On Pulse `onpulse` - The onPulse() method executes when a 'pulse' type parameter is pulsed by clicking on it or via the [Par](Par_Class.html "Par Class").pulse() method.
Expression Change `expressionchange` - The onExpressionChange() method executes whenever the specified parameter's expression changes. For example, changing the expression from `me.time.frame` to `me.time.seconds` will trigger the script.
Export Change `exportchange` - The onExportChange() method executes if the export path to the specified parameter changes. For example, if the parameter is being exported to from /chopname/chan1 and that is changed so /chopname2/chan2 is now exporting to it, then the script will be triggered.
Enable Change `enablechange` - The onEnableChange() method executes if the specified parameter goes from being disabled to enabled.
Mode Change `modechange` - The onModeChange() method executes if the specified [parameter's mode](Parameter_Mode.html "Parameter Mode") changes between the available constant, expression, export or bind mode.
Custom `custom` - Monitor [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters").
Built-In `builtin` - Monitor Built-In parameters.

ParCollection Class - Derivative

# ParCollection Class

The ParCollection class can be used to access [Parameters](Par_Class.html "Par Class"). To access a parameter you need to use its internal name, which you can obtain by hovering your mouse over the parameter name, and looking at the popup that will come up. See also [Par Class](Par_Class.html "Par Class"). An operator's instance of this can be found in `OP.par`.

This object contains a member for each parameter in the component. You can both read the value using:

```
a = op('geo1').par.tx

You can also change the value using

```
a = op('geo1').par.tx = 4
a = op('geo1').par.lookat = 'null1'

`[name]`→ `Par`:

> [Parameters](Par_Class.html "Par Class") may be easily accessed using the [] subscript and assignment operators.
> 
> * name - Must be an exact string name. Wildcards are not supported. If not found None is returned.
> 
> ```
> p = op('base1').par['Myfloat5']
> 
> ```

ParGroupCollection Class - Derivative

# ParGroupCollection Class

The ParGroupCollection class can be used to access [ParGroups](ParGroup_Class.html "ParGroup Class"). To access a parGroup you need to use its internal name, which you can obtain by hovering your mouse over the parameter name, and looking at the popup that will come up. See also [ParGroup Class](ParGroup_Class.html "ParGroup Class"). An operator's instance of this can be found in `OP.parGroup`.

This object contains a member for each parGroup in the component. You can both read the value using:

```
a = op('geo1').par.t

```
a = op('geo1').parGroup.tx = (1,1,1) # transform has 3 values
a = op('geo1').parGroup.lookat = 'null1'

> [ParGroups](ParGroup_Class.html "ParGroup Class") may be easily accessed using the [] subscript and assignment operators.
> 
> * name - Must be an exact string name. Wildcards are not supported. If not found None is returned.
> 
> ```
> p = op('base1').parGroup['Myfloat5']
> 
> ```

Particle SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Particle SOP

The Particle SOP is used for creating and controlling motion of "particles" for particle systems simulations. Particle systems are often used to create simulations of natural events such as rain and snow, or effects such as fireworks and sparks. In Touch, the points of the input geometry are used as the starting positions of the particles. Each point of the input can be affected by external force (gravity) and wind. Particles can collide and bounce off another object, set by the Collision Source. They can also bounce off, or die at, limit planes set in X, Y and Z.

Particles are created with an initial velocity/direction that comes from the source geometry’s point normals, and that velocity can be controlled by modifying the normals using, for instance, a [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP"), [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP") or [Script SOP](Script_SOP.html "Script SOP"). A point with a Normal of magnitude 1 emit bear particles with a velocity of 1 unit per second in the direction of the normal.

Particles have various [Attributes](Attribute.html "Attribute") that regular geometry do not have, such as velocity, life expectancy and age. These attributes must be carried with each point in order to carry out the simulation.

The fourth input is Surface Attractors that cause the particles to be attached to areas of a surface. Each particle's id is used to determine a random target primitive, and random u,v on that primitive. That target position is used to modify the current velocity.

Source Group `sourcegrp` - Limit the particle emission to the points found in the specified point groups.

## Parameters - State Page

Particle Type `prtype` - ⊞ - Selects how the particles are rendered.

Behavior `behave` - ⊞ - Select between emitting particles from the geometry's points or deforming the original geometry using the Particle SOP's behavior.

* Particle System `psystem` - Act like a particle system, where particles are born from the input points.

* Modify Source Geometry `modify` - Deforms the source input geometry.

**Tip:** You can also instance geometry to particles. Use a [SOP to CHOP](SOP_to_CHOP.html "SOP to CHOP") to get the particle positions into CHOPs, and on the Instance page of the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") to position any geometry at each particle positions. This is by far the most efficient way of animating many copies of geometry with a particle system.

Compute Normals `normals` - Creates normals on the geometry. Only used when Behaviour is set to Modify Source Geometry.
Point Reuse `ptreuse` - ⊞ - Decide how the internal memory for points is reused when a point needs to be created or when a point dies.

* Reuse Points in Loop `loop` -

* Reuse First Available Point `unused` -

* Don't Reuse Points `none` -

Preroll Time `timepreroll` - How many seconds of the simulation to bypass, after the reset time is reached. For example, if you put the number `33` into this field (and reset is at `Tstart`), frame one will show the simulation that was at a time of 33 seconds. In other words, the first thirty-two seconds have been bypassed, and the time at thirty-three seconds is shifted to frame one. The first thirty-two seconds must still be calculated in order to compute the status of the points, so you will notice some delay upon reset.
Time Inc `timeinc` - The Time Inc parameter determines how often to cook the SOP. By default, this parameter is set to `1/me.time.rate`. This means that the SOP will cook once for every frame. When complex dynamics are involved, the SOP may require more frequent cooking for increased mathematical accuracy. To get sub-frame accuracy in the cooking, set the Time Inc to something smaller than `1/me.time.rate`.

**For example:** Setting the Time Inc to `0.5/me.time.rate` will mean that the SOP gets cooked twice for every frame.

**Note:** Never set this parameter to be greater than `1/me.time.rate`.

Max Steps `maxsteps` - Limits how far back in time TouchDesigner calculates particle positions for proper interactions. If frame rates are slow this computation back in time can become high, this parameter limits that effect.
Jitter Births `jitter` - This allows you to jitter the location pixels of each particle as they are born.
Accurate Moves `accurate` - This option makes the particles move more accurately between frames by calculating their trajectories for fractional frame values.
Remove Unused Points `rmunused` - Removes all unused points from the input geometry. This is provided as an explicit option instead of automatically because it saves the time needed to purge the points from memory during the simulation. This prevents unnecessary slowdowns during the simulation.
Attractor Use `attractmode` - ⊞ - Select which mode of attraction to use for Surface Attractors.

* All Points `all` - All point attractors affect all particles (or points).

* Single Point per Particle `single` - When enabled, each particle is assigned a single attractor point, and is affected by only that point. Assignment is done by point number modulo the total number of attractor points.

Reset `reset` - When On the particle system is held in a reset state and does not emit particles.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly reset the particle system to its starting state.

External Force `external` - ⊞ - Forces of gravity acting on the particles. When drag is zero, the particles can accelerate with no limit on their speed.

* X `externalx` -

* Y `externaly` -

* Z `externalz` -

Wind `wind` - ⊞ - Wind forces acting on the particles. Similar to External Force. Using Wind (and no other forces, such as Turbulence), the particles will not exceed the wind velocity.

#### Discussion - Wind vs External Force

The application of External Force directly affects a particles' acceleration, the rate of which is determined by the mass (F = Mass Acceleration). Wind is an additional force, but one that is velocity sensitive. If a particle is already travelling at wind velocity, then it shouldn't receive any extra force from it. This implies a maximum velocity when using Wind on its own.

An increase in mass impedes acceleration for a given constant force. Drag is a force opposing the direction of motion which is velocity sensitive, i.e. the larger the velocity, the greater the effect of drag. Its useful for limiting the velocity of particles.

* X `windx` -

* Y `windy` -

* Z `windz` -

Turbulence `turb` - ⊞ - The amplitude of turbulent (chaotic) forces along each axis. Use positive values, if any.

* X `turbx` -

* Y `turby` -

* Z `turbz` -

Turb Period `period` - A small period means that the turbulence varies quickly over a small area, while a larger value will cause points close to each other to be affected similarly.
Seed `seed` - Random number seed for the particle simulation.

## Parameters - Particles Page

Add Particle ID `doid` - Adds an ID number to each particle as it is born. **Note:** New attributes only appear once the particle system is reset via the `reset` parameter or loads for first time.
Add Mass Attribute `domass` - When selected, calculates the mass of the particle, as specified in the Mass field.
Mass `mass` - The relative mass of each particle. Heavier particles take longer to start moving, and longer to slow down.
Add Drag Attribute `dodrag` - When selected, calculates the drag coefficient of the particle, as entered in the Drag field.
Drag `drag` - Drag of each particle.
Birth `birth` - The number of particles born each second. Particles are not released in clusters. They are born at random times during the first frame of their existence. Their birth time is set randomly during the first frame.
Life Expect `life` - How long each particle will exist, in seconds. The default is `3` seconds. You may want to adjust this number based on the length of your animation.
Life Variance `lifevar` - Variance of a particle's life expectancy in seconds. If life expectancy is one second, and the variance is zero seconds, each particle will live exactly one second. If variance is set to 0.5, then some particles will live only a half second, while others will live a second and a half. The rest will live some time in-between. This randomness gives a more natural look to the particle births.
Alpha Speed `alpha` - As a particle goes faster, it should become more transparent. The Alpha Speed parameter defaults to 0, which doesn't change alpha as the speed increases. A typical value of 0.5 causes the particle to be 70% opaque when it's going 1 unit/second. Increasing the Alpha Speed parameter makes it more transparent at a given speed. At zero speed, a particle is always 100% opaque.
Surface Attraction `subattract` - Gives control over how much particles are attracted towards the Particle SOP's 4th input surface attractor.
Birth Count `birthcount` - Specifies the number of particles created when the Birth pulse parameter is hit.
Birth `birthpulse` - Manually create n particles when pulsed. The number of particles created is controlled by the Birth Count parameter.

+ Limit Plane `limitpos` - ⊞ - The particles will die or bounce off the limit planes when it reaches them. The six limit plane fields define a bounding cube. The default settings are `1000` units away, which is very large. Reduce the values to about one to see the effect.

* X `limitposx` -

* Y `limitposy` -

* Z `limitposz` -

* X `limitnegx` -

* Y `limitnegy` -

* Z `limitnegz` -

Hit Behavior `hit` - ⊞ - Control over what happens when a particle hits either the six collision planes or the collide object. The options are:

* Die on Contact `die` - The particles will disappear when they collide with the Collision input.

* Bounce on Contact `bounce` - The particles will bounce upon contact with the Collision input.

* Stick on Contact `stick` - The particles will stick to the Collision input.

Gain Tangent `gaintan` - Friction parameters which can be regarded as energy loss upon collision. The first parameter affects the energy loss (gain) perpendicular to the surface. 0 means all energy (velocity) is lost, 1 means no energy is lost perpendicular to surface. The second parameter is the energy gain tangent to the surface.
Gain Normal `gainnorm` - Friction parameters which can be regarded as energy loss upon collision. The first parameter affects the energy loss (gain) perpendicular to the surface. 0 means all energy (velocity) is lost, 1 means no energy is lost perpendicular to surface. The second parameter is the energy gain tangent to the surface.

* 1 and 1 means nothing is lost or gained.
* 0.1 and 1 cause the particles to strike the surface and dribble along it, like rain atop a roof.
* 1 and 0 makes them bounce perpendicular to the surface, no matter what angle they came in at.
* -1 and 1 makes the particle bounce back from whence it came.
* Gains greater than 1 cause energy gain (like a pinball machine bumper).

Split `splittype` - ⊞ - Select if the particle will split and under what conditions.

* No Splitting `no` - The default setting, this keeps the particles intact.

* Split on Contact `bounce` - The particles will split upon contact with the Collision Source.

* Split on Death `die` - The particles will split when they die.

Min/Max Splits `split` - ⊞ - When a particle splits, it splits into a number of other particles. The number of particles is randomly set between this range.

* `splitmin` -

* `splitmax` -

Split Velocity `splitvel` - ⊞ - Each split particle is given this base velocity.

* X `splitvelx` -

* Y `splitvely` -

* Z `splitvelz` -

Velocity Variance `splitvar` - ⊞ - This is a random amount that is added to the split velocity. When creating fireworks, the variance is large while the velocity is low. When rendering raindrops splashing, the split velocity is large in Y, and the variance in X and Z causes the particles to bounce up - but randomly - in the XZ plane.

* X `splitvarx` -

* Y `splitvary` -

* Z `splitvarz` -

Pattern CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Pattern CHOP

The Pattern CHOP generates a sequence of samples in a channel. Unlike the [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP") its purpose is generating arrays of samples that have no reference to time (seconds or frames).

It is useful for curve generation like lookup tables, simple shapes that can be converted to SOPs, generating channels that are passed to the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") to generate instances, and other non-time-based curve-generation, with as little need to make expressions in Python.

All defaults are in samples, not seconds or frames (though like all CHOPs, it carries with it a sample rate). There is no start-end, just Length in samples.

**Tip**: To display a CHOP viewer in the units of samples, make the [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active") and change [RMB](Mouse_Click.html "Mouse Click") -> Units to be Samples.

The Pattern CHOP optionally takes one input CHOP to match the length and sample rate, and, choosing via the Combine Channels menu, Appends or Inserts the new channel(s), Replaces the incoming channels, Adds to the incoming channels or Multiplies the incoming channels.

The Pattern CHOP defaults to one cycle of the curve over the length of the CHOP, no matter how many samples long.

**Tip: Customizing each channel:** The python object for the Pattern CHOP has a `chanIndex` member, so if Pattern generates three channels you can put something like `[1, 3, 7][me.chanIndex]` in any parameter to customize its value for each channel. For example, in the Type parameter, put the expression `['sin', 'cos', 'ramp'][me.chanIndex]` to get 3 different curve types.

Seed `seed` - The seed for the random Types.
Phase `phase` - Shifts the cycle.
Phase Step per Channel `phasestep` - Increases the phase for each channel. A Phase Step of .25 when there are 2 channels will shift the second channel to be 1/4 cycle later phase than the first phase, where if the 2 channels are used for x and y, will draw a circle when passed to a CHOP to SOP.
Taper `taper` - ⊞ - Two parameters to multiply by a line from `taper1` at the start to `taper2` at the end. The default of (`1 1`) has no effect.

Reverse `reverse` - Reverses the final order of the samples as in the [Stretch CHOP](Stretch_CHOP.html "Stretch CHOP").
Randomize `randomize` - When the Type parameter above is set to Random Non-Repeating Integers, this trigger will randomize all the values.

Channel Names `channelname` - You can creates many channels with simple patterns like `chan[1-20]`, which generates 20 channels from `chan1` to `chan20`, or `t[xyz]` which generates `tx`, `ty` and `tz`. See the section, Common CHOP Parameters for a description of this and all Options. See [Scope and Channel Name Matching](CHOP_Common_Page.html#Scope "CHOP Common Page") Options.
Combine Channels `combine` - ⊞ - If an input CHOP is attached, it adopts the length and sample rate of the input CHOP, and

* Off `off` - It only adopts the length and sample rate of the input.

* Append `append` - It appends the new Pattern CHOP channels after the last incoming channel.

* Insert `insert` - It inserts the new channels before the first incoming channel.

* Replace `replace` - It replaces the incoming channels using channel-name-matching.

* Add `add` - It adds incoming channels to the generated channels, matching by channel-name-matching.

* Multiply `multiply` - It multiplies incoming channels with the generated channels, matching by channel-name-matching.

Extra Information for the Pattern CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

PBR MAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# PBR MAT

The PBR MAT creates a material using a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) lighting model. It has support for textures, reflections, bumps, cone lights, rim lights, alpha maps and more.

It also supports most [Adobe Substance 3D Designer](https://substance3d.adobe.com/community-assets) PBR materials loaded in the [Substance TOP](Substance_TOP.html "Substance TOP").

You can output its [GLSL shader](Category_GLSL.html "Category:GLSL") into two [DATs](DAT.html "DAT") for further adaptation in a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") by using the Output Shader parameter.

This OP creates physically based materials from texture maps you assign to it and works with any content pipeline whether you use Maya, Houdini, Unreal, Photoshop etc.

You can get more PBR materials from PBR texture libraries such as [Quixel](http://quixel.se/) and [Poliigon](http://www.poliigon.com/) and [Game Textures](https://gametextures.com/freebies).

Output Shader... `outputshader` - This button will bring up a dialog that will create a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") and [Text DATs](Text_DAT.html "Text DAT") with shader code that this PBR MAT is currently using. Since shaders are dependent on the number and type of lights, it will list some possible different shader choices, based on what lighting configurations have been used in the current system. **If no shaders are listed in the dialog**, it means no shader has been rendered in the current session of TouchDesigner. Turn on the viewer for the Phong MAT, or setup a render in a Render TOP. That will create/compile some shaders and will cause the list to be populated. For example if you want to see a shader that does shadow mapping, setup a render that does shadow mapping and you will see that come up in the list.

## Parameters - Maps Page

## Parameters - Alpha Page

**Note: Simply applying alpha to an object does not make it transparent. For more information refer to the [Transparency](Transparency.html "Transparency") article.**

Alpha Map `alphamap` - ⊞ - This map multiplies the alpha of the object. It uses the red channel of the map, other channels are ignored.

Uniform Alpha `alphamode` - Turning this off will make the alpha change depending on orientation of each polygon's normal compared to the camera. Normals that are pointing at the camera will results in the polygon having an alpha of Alpha Front. Normals that are perpendicular to the camera (facing sideways/up/down) will have Alpha Side for their alpha.
Alpha Front `alphafront` - The opacity of the material. This parameter is multiplied by point alpha of the object (as will as any other alpha source).
Alpha Side `alphaside` - This is used for non-uniform alpha. It is the alpha value polygons that are facing away from the camera will get.
Alpha Rolloff `rolloff` - Controls how the alpha changes from Alpha Front to Alpha Side.
Post-Mult Color by Alpha `postmultalpha` - At the end of all of the calculations, the color (RGB) is multiplied by the calculated alpha. You can stop this from happening by turning off this checkbox.

# Perform CHOP

The Perform CHOP outputs many channels like frames-per-second, describing the current state of the TouchDesigner process. As channels they can be manipulated into user interfaces and calculations to adjust real-time self-tuning of the process.

It outputs the "cook time" of the prior frame that was drawn, which is a reflection of how many frames TouchDesigner cooked in the prior second. The `cook`

**Tip**: Put a Trail CHOP after the Perform CHOP to watch its progress.

channel, when sent to a Trail CHOP shows which frames were cooked and which were skipped, useful in optimizing your work to reach a desired frame rate.

The Built-in Variables found on Dialogs -> Variables -> Built-in include more useful data on your running system. See also the Built-in Variables section of the [Variables](Variables.html "Variables") page.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[performCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PerformCHOP_Class "PerformCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Perform Page

This is a listing of the channels output from the Perform CHOP.

Frames per Second `fps` - The number of frames rendered in the last second.
Frame Time `msec` - Amount of time each frame takes to cook in msec.
Cook `cook` - Is equal to 1 when a frame is cooked and equal to 0 when a frame is skipped. It is often useful to view this channel in a [Trail CHOP](Trail_CHOP.html "Trail CHOP") to see when frames are skipped (dropped).
Dropped Frames `droppedframes` - The number of frames dropped between the last frame and the current frame.
Movie Read Ahead Misses `mvreadahead` - How many times the movie read ahead failed to maintain the number of specified Read Ahead frames.
GPU Mem Used (MB) `gpumemused` - Amount of GPU memory used (in megabytes).
Total GPU Mem (MB) `totalgpumem` - Total amount of GPU memory available on the system (in megabytes).
Total Active OPs `activeops` - How many OPs are actively cooking.
Total Deactivated OP Calls `deactivatedops` - Number of calls to cook a component that has its [Cooking Flag](Cooking_Flag.html "Cooking Flag") turned off.

CPU Mem Used (MB) `cpumemused` - Amount of CPU memory used (in megabytes).
Cook State `cookstate` - Monitors which frames actually cooked. Pass the Perform CHOP to a Trail CHOP to properly see the trail of frames that did and did not cook. (It appears as always 1 because the viewer is displaying only the current frame and not frames it missed.)
Cook Realtime `cookrealtime` - Monitors the state of the realtime flag, determining if TouchDesigner is running in realtime mode or not.
Cookrate `cookrate` - The global target cook rate (frames per second) of the project. This is the frames per second of the root component, `root.time.rate`, typically `60`, though due to frames taking too long to cook, the actual frames per second may be lower.
Time Slice Step `timeslicestep` - The number of frames that TouchDesigner stepped forward for the current cook. It's the length of the [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") in frames. It will be equal to 1 when the system is taking `1000/root.time.rate` msec or less to complete one frame (16.666 msec for a rate of 60).
Time Slice Milliseconds `timeslicemsec` - The length of the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") in milliseconds.
Perform Mode `performmode` - Monitors the state of [Perform Mode](Perform_Mode.html "Perform Mode").
Perform Window Focus `performfocus` - Monitors if the Perform Window currently has focus or not.

Active Expressions `activeexpressions` - The number of active python expressions found in the project.
Optimized Expressions `optimizedexpression` - The number of python expression that have been optimized, see [Optimized Python Expressions](Optimized_Python_Expressions.html "Optimized Python Expressions").
Expressions Using Cache `cachedexpressions` - The number of python expression that have been cached, see [Optimized Python Expressions](Optimized_Python_Expressions.html "Optimized Python Expressions").

Phaser CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Phaser CHOP

The Phaser CHOP does staggered (time-offset) animation interpolation. Phaser outputs one channel with multi-samples. Each sample animates from 0 to 1 over a cycle, but each sample value rises from 0 and arrives at 1 at different times.

For example, you may have a set of N objects that you want to animate from a start position to an end position. You set Num Samples to N, which will make the Phaser CHOP output one channel with N samples that will animate the samples from 0 to 1 and be interpolated with an easing function. In the Phaser CHOP the start-to-end cycle is controlled by the first input of the CHOP, which is expected to be one channel with value between 0 to 1.

The 0-1 values can be used with the [Lookup CHOP](Lookup_CHOP.html "Lookup CHOP") to animate groups of channels.

By default the timing is staggered uniformly. If you want to stagger their transitions irregularly, you use the second input, a set of values in one CHOP channel (typically N samples) that are between 0 and 1. The phase value specifies the object's timing relationship with the rest of those in the CHOP. A phase value of 1 corresponds to an animated object thats "ahead of the pack" (ie. it will start animating before the others). A value of 0 corresponds to an object that is late (ie. it will be the last to start easing/animating). If a phase input is not provided then the phase will simply be i/N where N is the total number of objects (ie. samples), and i is the index of the current sample.

There is also a notion of an "Edge" in the Phaser, which describes the cohesiveness of the group of animated objects and how fast the samples rise. A small value will cause the objects to go through the animation very quickly or at high value, very slowly and in unison with other samples.

Look at David Braun's **[TouchDesigner Summit Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4PQW4f34c8)** to see the background of the Phaser CHOP. Its functionality draws heavily from David's research and development in quantitative easing.

See also the [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets").

## Parameters - Phaser Page

Edge `edge` - The separation edge of the phasing between two states. A smaller edge corresponds to sharper separation according to differences in phase. Edge Parameter will not be used if there is an Edge Input.

* Multi-Samples `samples` - Multiple samples in a channel.

* Multi-Channel `channels` - Multiple channels.

* Input 0: Time - The timing of the phase. When not wired the timing will default to an LFO ramp over 4 seconds. The CHOP should only contain one channel; all other channels except the first will be ignored.
* Input 1: Phase - When wired the Phaser CHOP's output will mirror the phase input's. However, if Mult-Channel Output Format is selected it will in effect transpose the output.
* Input 2: Edge - Edge samples will be used instead of the Edge parameter.

Phong MAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Phong MAT

The Phong MAT creates a material using the Phong Shading model. It has support for textures, reflections, bumps, cone lights, rim lights, alpha maps and more. You can output its [GLSL shader](Category_GLSL.html "Category:GLSL") into two [DATs](DAT.html "DAT") for further adaptation in a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") by using the Output Shader parameter.

Phong Shading models three types of reflected light:

* Ambient - Ambient is considered light that does not come from any particular direction and is therefore constant across the surface. In the physical world, ambient light is created from the reflection of light off surfaces in the environment.
* Diffuse - Diffuse models the light reflected by matte surfaces. This light is reflected equally in all directions, therefore the position of the observer does not effect the percieved illumination.
* Specular - Specular models the light reflected by glossy surfaces. This light is reflected mainly in the direction of the reflected ray and is attenuated by the 'shiny-ness' of an object. Since the light reflected from the surface is mainly in the direction of the reflected ray, the position of the observer determines the specular highlight on the surface.

> **NOTE:** We see the color of an object because of the color of light that the material reflects.

Phong Shading produces very nice specular highlights, although it is still an approximation and not physically accurate. Contrasting with the Gouraud shading model that calculates the lighting at each vertex and interpolates the value across the polygon, Phong calculates the lighting at each pixel.

To see how all of the different parts are summed together by looking at the [Phong Lighting Equation](https://docs.derivative.ca/Phong_Lighting_Equation "Phong Lighting Equation") article.

Emit `emit` - ⊞ - This is the color that the material will emit even if there is no light.

Shininess `shininess` - Controls the specular highlights (glossyness) of an object. Higher settings are more glossy, like plastic or shiny metal. Lower settings give more of a matte finish.
Color Map `colormap` - ⊞ - Specifies a TOP texture that is multiplied by the results of all of the lighting calculations. The alpha of this map is used as a part of calculating the objects alpha. Clicking on the arrows to the right of the map field will open the [Texture Sampling Parameters](Texture_Sampling_Parameters.html "Texture Sampling Parameters") for Color Map. The other Map parameters below will have their own Texture Sampling Parameters as well.
Extend U `colormapextendu` - ⊞ -

Bump Scale `bumpscale` - A multiplier for the 'bump effect' created by the Normal Map parameter.
Enable Height Map `heightmapenable` - Enables height mapping.
Height Map `heightmap` - ⊞ - Specifies a height texture map. The height map is used in conjunction with the normal map to perform parallax mapping.
Extend U `heightmapextendu` - ⊞ -

Parallax Scale `parallaxscale` - Scale value applied to the height map. Can be used to increase or exaggerate the effect.
Parallax Occlusion `parallaxocclusion` - Enables parallax occlusion, an enhancement of the parallax mapping technique used with the height map. Parallax occlusion improves the quality of the texture offsetting in parallax mapping so that the higher parts of the height map appear to occlude the lower parts, giving a better illusion of height.
Displace Vertices `displaceverts` - When Enable Height Map above is On, setting Displace Vertices to On will enable true displacement mapping where the vertices of the geometry are displaced based on the Height Map texture and the parameters below.
Displace Scale `displacescale` - A multiplier for the displacement amount.
Displace Midpoint `displacemid` - Sets the middle point of displacement map as the start position for the displacement effect.

Emit Map `emitmap` - ⊞ - Specifies a TOP texture that is multiplied with the Emit color parameter of the material. The object must have texture coordinates. The alpha of this map is ignored.
Extend U `emitmapextendu` - ⊞ -

Environment Map `envmap` - ⊞ - Uses a TOP texture to define an environment map for the material. Environment mapping simulates an object reflecting its surroundings. The TOP defined in this parameter is the texture that will be reflected. The Env Map is added to whatever the normal lighting will be, so to make an object purely reflective turn the Diffuse and Specular parameters to 0. This input expects a sphere map. An example of a sphere map can be found [here](http://debevec.org/Probes/campus_probe.jpg). This input will also accept a cube map, created with the [Cube Map TOP](Cube_Map_TOP.html "Cube Map TOP") or the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP")'s Render Cube Map parameter.

* Sphere Map `spheremap` -

* Equirectangular `equirect` -

Output Shader... `outputshader` - This button will bring up a dialog that will create a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") and [Text DATs](Text_DAT.html "Text DAT") with shader code that matches whatever effect this Phong MAT is currently creating. Since shaders are dependent on the number and type of lights, it will list some possible different shader choices, based on what lighting configurations have been used in the current system. **If no shaders are listed in the dialog**, it means no shader has been rendered in the current session of TouchDesigner. Turn on the viewer for the Phong MAT, or setup a render in a Render TOP. That will create/compile some shaders and will cause the list to be populated. For example if you want to see a shader that does shadow mapping, setup a render that does shadow mapping and you will see that come up in the list.

Uniform Alpha `alphamode` - Turning this off will make the alpha change depending on orientation of each polygon's normal compared to the camera. Normals that are pointing at the camera will results in the polygon having an alpha of Alpha Front. Normals that are perpendicular to the camera (facing sideways/up/down) will have Alpha Side for their alpha.
Alpha Front `alphafront` - The opacity of the material. This parameter is multiplied by point alpha of the object (as will as any other alpha source).
Alpha Side `alphaside` - This is used for non-uniform alpha. It is the alpha value polygons that are facing away from the camera will get.
Alpha Rolloff `rolloff` - Controls how the alpha changes from Alpha Front to Alpha Side.
Post-Mult Color by Alpha `postmultalpha` - At the end of all of the calculations, the color (RGB) is multiplied by the calculated alpha. You can stop this from happening by turning off this toggle.
Mult Alpha by Light Luminance `alphamultlight` - When this is enabled, the luminance of the lighting will be multiplied by the alpha, to decrease/increase it.

## Parameters - Multi-Texturing Page

On the Multi-texturing page of the Phong material, you can have up to 4 texture maps and choose any of the 8 possible texture coordinates for each map. By default the texture maps are multiplied together, but there is a field for a custom GLSL code that can be used. Here's how that works:

The 4 texture maps are referred to in the parameter by t0, t1, t2 and t3 respectively. So the default equation if all 4 texture maps are used is: t0 \* t1 \* t2 \* t3. You can use and constants and other math operators, so for example t0 + (t1 \* 0.5) is valid. If they refer to a map that doesn't exist, the shader won't compile correctly (e.g. using t3 when it isn't set or the TOP doesn't exist).

They can also refer to specific components of the texture using .r .g .b and .a. So for example if you want to do t0 over t1, the expression would be:

```
t0 + (t1 * (1.0 - t0.a))

**The output from your expression must be a vec4**, so for example:

```
 t0.rgb + t1.rgb // Error				
 vec4(t0.rgb + t1.rgb, 1.0)  // Works

The alpha from the result of these maps is used.

Multi-Texturing (Disables Color Map) `multitexturing` - Enables multi-texturing. This disables the Color Map parameter.

Coord Interpolation `texture4coordnterp` - ⊞ -

GLSL Expression `multitexexpr` - GLSL code that combines the texture images (look to the start of this section for more details). This parameter can be left blank (which means the maps will just be multiplied together).

Secondary Specular `spec2` - ⊞ - Adds a secondary specular highlight color.

* Red `spec2r` -

* Green `spec2g` -

* Blue `spec2b` -

Secondary Shininess `shininess2` - Controls the secondary specular highlights (glossyness) of an object. Higher settings are more glossy, like plastic or shiny metal. Lower settings give more of a matte finish.
Write Camera Space Depth to Alpha `writecameradepthtoalpha` - This causes the camera space depth of the pixel to be written to the alpha channel of the output TOP. This value can be useful for post-processing effects, but ofcourse you will not have the result of all the alpha calculations if you turn this on (although they'll get used to multiply the output color, assuming Post-Mult Color by Alpha is enabled.
Apply Point Color `applypointcolor` - Normally the color attribute (Cd[4]) coming from the SOP is used in the lighting calculation, you can turn off using the color attribute by un-checking this parameter.
Instance Texture `instancetexture` - ⊞ - When provider per-instance textures in the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP"), this parameter selects which map the instance texture will be applied as.

Pipe In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Pipe In CHOP

The Pipe In CHOP allows users to input from custom devices into CHOPs. It is implemented as a TCP/IP network connection.

The connection can be from a user-written program that outputs to the Pipe In CHOP's port, or from another TouchDesigner process, where the data is coming from a [Pipe Out CHOP](Pipe_Out_CHOP.html "Pipe Out CHOP").

Regular channel data sent to Pipe In outputs has CHOP channels (channel names with floating point values every frame). Mixed with it can be TouchDesigner scripting commands that get executed when they arrive.

**TIP:** The [TCP/IP DAT](TCP/IP_DAT.html "TCP/IP DAT") or [UDP In DAT](UDP_In_DAT.html "UDP In DAT") is the preferred way to send script commands and other data packets over the network.

This node differs from the [Touch In CHOP](Touch_In_CHOP.html "Touch In CHOP") as it functions using a stream of commands, instead of a simple stream of channel data like the [Touch In CHOP](Touch_In_CHOP.html "Touch In CHOP"). Information comes in in various commands which are documented in the files located in your installation directory
`C:/Program Files/Derivative/TouchDesigner*/touch/docs/pipe`.

To receive network data from another "server" computer (e.g. from a TouchDesigner Pipe Out CHOP running remotely), a connection must be established between the server and the Pipe In CHOP before data is sent. You must supply the Server Address and Port from which to receive incoming data to a channel. The server should be listening for connections on the port that this CHOP is using.

## Parameters - PipeIn Page

Connection Mode `mode` - ⊞ - Set operation as server or client.

* This Operator is Client `client` -

* This Operator is Server `server` -

Server Address `address` - The network address of the server computer. This address is a standard WWW address, such as '`foo`' or '`foo.bar.com`'. You can use an IP address (e.g. `100.123.45.78`) or the computer's network name can be entered. If you put "`localhost`", it means the other end of the pipe is on the same computer.
Server Port `port` - The network port of the server.
Active `active` - While On, the CHOP receives information from the pipe or server. While Off, no updating occurs. Data sent by a server is lost, but a pipe will store the data until Active is turned on again. If in Network mode, turning this parameter on initiates a connection, and turning it off breaks the connection.
Queued `queued` - When checked on, the network queuing is enabled. See the following parameters.
Minimum Target `mintarget` - The lower end of the queue target range. The Pipe In CHOP will try to maintain a queue length greater than or equal to this value.
Min Unit `mintargetunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Maximum Target `maxtarget` - The upper end of the queue target range. The Pipe In CHOP will try to maintain a queue length less than or equal to this value.
Max Unit `maxtargetunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Maximum Queue `maxqueue` - The maximum size of the queue when full. Incoming samples will be dropped if the maximum queue is reached. **This also affects the maximum number of script commands that can be queued up before they start gettting dropped.**
Max Queue Unit `maxqueueunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Queue Adjust Time `adjusttime` - Specifies how often to repeat/drop a samples in order to get closer to the queue target range. If the value = 1 and the units = seconds, then it will try to repeat/drop a sample once per second to maintain the queue target set in the Minimum Target and Maximum Target parameters above.
Adjust Unit `adjusttimeunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Reset Channels `reset` - Discards and clears all channels and incoming data.
Allow Incoming Scripts `allowscripts` - Incoming script commands will be ignored unless this parameter is turned On. Turning it Off is more secure.
Echo Messages to Console `echo` - ⊞ - Print all incoming commands (not channel data) to the Console which can be opened from the Dialogs menu. A good way to test a connection is to put "`echo X`" commands in the incoming stream.

* Full Messages to Console `on` -

* All Events to Console `raw` -

Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callbacks for each event received. See [pipeinCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PipeinCHOP_Class "PipeinCHOP Class") for usage.

Pipe Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Pipe Out CHOP

The Pipe Out CHOP can be used to transmit data out of TouchDesigner to other processes running on a remote machine using a network connection. If the other process is another TouchDesigner process, a [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP") in that process can be used to receive the data. Multiple PipeIn CHOPs can connect to a PipeOut CHOP.

For more information on how to connect two TouchDesigner processes running on different machines with a Pipe In and Pipe Out CHOP, see the [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP").

**NOTE:** For TouchDesigner-to-TouchDesigner communication of channel data, see the [Touch In CHOP](Touch_In_CHOP.html "Touch In CHOP") and [Touch Out CHOP](Touch_Out_CHOP.html "Touch Out CHOP") which offer optimized and [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") data transfer.

**TIP:** The [TCP/IP DAT](TCP/IP_DAT.html "TCP/IP DAT") or [UDP Out DAT](UDP_Out_DAT.html "UDP Out DAT") is the preferred way to send script commands and other data packets over the network.

## Parameters - PipeOut Page

Server Address `address` - The computer name or IP address of the server computer. This address is a standard WWW address, such as '`foo`' or '`foo.bar.com`'. You can use an IP address (e.g. `100.123.45.78`) or the computer's network name can be entered. If you put "`localhost`", it means the other end of the pipe is on the same computer.
Server Port `port` - The network port to use.
Active `active` - When Off, data is not sent.
Send Input `sendinput` - On/off toggle for sending the data connected to the Pipe Out CHOP's input.
Send Current Sample Only `sendsingle` - This parameter is only enabled if the Pipe Out CHOP is not [time sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") (See Common Page of parameters). If On, it only sends the current frame's sample. If Off, it sends all data between this frame and the last frame TouchDesigner cooked at. The difference arises when TouchDesigner is not cooking 60 frames per second and is skipping frames. If playback skips by 3 animation frames between screen draws, the On case sends only one frame of data, and the Off case sends 3 frames of data (a "[Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)")" in TouchDesigner-speak).
Single Sample `sample` - ⊞ - In single sample mode, this parameter determines which sample to send; the sample at frame 1 or the current sample.

* Current Frame `scur` -

* Frame 1 `sstart` -

Send All Data `upload` - When the button is pressed, sends all the channel names and their data once in one burst.
Script `script` - Use these parameters to send a one-time textport command through the pipe.
Send Script `sendscript` - Use these parameters to send a one-time textport command through the pipe.
Cook Every Frame `cookalways` - Turn this on to make sure this CHOP gets processed every frame. Usually CHOPs do not get processed every frame unless they are directly involved with some aspect of the geometry being displayed.
Send Monitor Pulses `pulse` - Sends pulses (a single null character) once a frame, to monitor the connection. This keeps the connection active, and keeps the Pipe In CHOP aware of the connection status so it can properly report its state.
Echo Messages to Console `echo` - Print all outgoing data to the Console which can be opened from the Dialogs menu. See this option in the [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP") for more details.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callback methods for each event sent. See [pipeoutCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PipeoutCHOP_Class "PipeoutCHOP Class") for usage.

Extra Information for the Pipe Out CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Point Class - Derivative

# Point Class

A Point describes an instance to a single [geometry point](Point.html "Point"). They are accessible through the [SOP.points](SOP_Class.html "SOP Class") member.

> The point index in the list.

`P` → `td.AttributeData` :

> The coordinates as [AttributeData](AttributeData_Class.html "AttributeData Class"). Individual components can be read or written with the [] operator.
> 
> ```
> point.P[0] = 5
> point.P = (1,0,1)
> 
> ```

> Get or set x coordinate value. This is the same as P[0].

> Get or set y coordinate value. This is the same as P[1].

`z` → `float` :

> Get or set z coordinate value. This is the same as P[2].

`normP` → `tdu.Position` **(Read Only)**:

> The normalized position of this point within the bounding box of the SOP. Will always be in the range [0,1]. Expressed as tdu.Position object.

### Attributes[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:SubSection&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Attributes")]

In addition to the above members, all [attributes](Attribute_Class.html "Attribute Class") are members as well.

For example, if the Point contains texture coordinates, they may be accessed with:`Point.uv`

```
box = op('box1')
print(box.N[0], box.N[1], box.N[2])
print(box.uv[0], box.uv[1], box.uv[2])

See: [Attribute Class](Attribute_Class.html "Attribute Class") for more information.

> Destroy and remove the actual point this object refers to. This operation is only valid when the primitive belongs to a [scriptSOP](https://docs.derivative.ca/ScriptSOP_Class "ScriptSOP Class"). Note: after this call, other existing Point objects in this SOP may no longer be valid.

# Point File In TOP

The Point File In TOP loads 3D point data into TOPs from either a single file or a sequence of files. Points are composed of one or more floating point values such as XYZ positions, RGB color values, 3D normals, scanner intensity, etc. The Point File in TOP will load all available point data, but only four channels can be placed into the output image. By default, the first four point data channels are placed into the red, green, blue and alpha channels respectively; however, you can assign any point channel to a colour channel using the parameters on the Point Data page. Attach a [Point File Select TOP](Point_File_Select_TOP.html "Point File Select TOP") to create additional output images from the same source file.

The Point File In TOP will read point data from various mesh and floating point data files including: `.obj`, `.ply`, `.fits` (astronomy format), and `.exr`. It can also load ASCII point files (`.xyz`, `.pts`, `.csv`, `.txt`, etc) with one point per line and comma or space separated fields. The first line in ASCII point files can either be the number of points, the names of the point fields or the first point in the file.

For a complete list, see [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types"). The [OpenEXR](https://docs.derivative.ca/OpenEXR "OpenEXR") file format is generally best to use as it is binary, can be read in multi-frame file sequences that uses TouchDesigner's movie file pre-reading and buffering, and can be written from TouchDesigner's [Movie File Out TOP](Movie_File_Out_TOP.html "Movie File Out TOP") with unlimited numbers of channels.

Examine the state of a Point File In TOP by attaching an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP"). This will show information like the number of points, fields per point and the number of frames. It also shows dynamic information like the file open status, current frame, readahead frames and queue size, dropped frame count, CPU decode time and GPU upload time.

**Headers**: If the file contains any additional header data, this can be viewed by attaching an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT"). Header data is stored as key-value pairs with the keys in the first column and the corresponding data in the second column, which can easily be interpreted with python.

All of the ASCII point list formats are loaded the same way whether their extention is `txt`, `csv`, `xyz`, etc. The parser looks for the first separating character (comma, space or tab) and then uses that to delimit the rest of the file. It will ignore delimiters that are inside single or double quotes. There are a few special rules depending on the delimiter style e.g. multiple spaces are merged together, but a comma at the end of a line indicates a blank field afterwards. Once a delimiter is established, The first line can be the number of points, but it is ignored. If the next line are strings then it is treated as a row of headers (channel names). Each row after that is considered a point.

## Parameters - Point Data Page

Control how the point's field data is placed into the output image.

The custom toggles control whether to use a custom field name to select which field is placed in the corresponding color channel. If false, the fields are selected in order e.g. the first field goes in red, the second in green, etc.

When set to custom, you can select the field from the dropdown menu or enter it directly. This parameter will be disabled if the color channel is not available in the output image format (see Pixel Format parameter).

File `file` - The path and name of the point file to load. Point file formats are those found in [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types"). You can specify files on the internet using `http://` ...

To treat a folder of files as an animation, specify the folder containing the files instead of a filename. All of the files must be the same resolution. It will treat each file in that folder as one frame in the animation. The order of the files is alphanumeric. By default the first file has an index of 0, second is 1, etc, regardless of their file names. Overriding the sample rate on the Trim parameter page will let you playback the animation at any frame rate.

Using an `info.xml` file in the directory containing a sequence of files allows you to specify the frames per second. Example xml file:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1" standalone="yes" ?>
  <Settings>
      <attributes fps="30.0" />
  </Settings>

URLs can be used to fetch files. The file is downloaded to the user's Derivative temp directory and is read into the Point File In TOP.

Reload `reload` - Change from 0 to 1 to force the file to reload. Useful when the file changes or did not exist at first.
Reload Pulse `reloadpulse` - Immediately reload the point data file.
Red `red` - ⊞ - Select one of the available point data channels to place it into the red channel of the output image. Selecting One or Zero will place the constance value into the output channel.

* Zero `Zero` -

* One `One` -

Green `green` - ⊞ - Select one of the available point data channels to place it into the green channel of the output image. Selecting One or Zero will place the constance value into the output channel.

Blue `blue` - ⊞ - Select one of the available point data channels to place it into the blue channel of the output image. Selecting One or Zero will place the constance value into the output channel.

Alpha `alpha` - ⊞ - Select one of the available point data channels to place it into the alpha channel of the output image. Selecting One or Zero will place the constance value into the output channel.

Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Specifies the method used to play the animation, there are 3 options.

* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the animation to the timeline. Scrubbing or jumping in the timeline will change the animation position accordingly. The parameters Play, Reset, Speed, and Index are disabled in this mode since the timeline is directly tied to position.

* Specify Index `specify` - This mode allows the user to specify a particular position in the animation using the Index parameter below. Use this mode for random access to any location in the movie.

Play `play` - Animation plays when 1, stops when 0.
Speed `speed` - This is a speed multiplier which only works when Play Mode is *Sequential*. A value of 1 is the default playback speed. A value of 2 is double speed, 0.5 is half speed and so on. Negative values will play the animation backwards.
Cue `cue` - Jumps to Cue Point when set to 1. Only available when Play Mode is Sequential.
Cue Pulse `cuepulse` - Instantly jumps to the Cue Point position in the movie.
Cue Point `cuepoint` - Set any index in the animation as a point to jump to.
Cue Point Unit `cuepointunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Index `index` - This parameter explicitly sets the file sequence position when Play Mode is set to Specify Index. The units menu on the right lets you specify the index in the following units: Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage). For example, assume you have a sequence that internally is 25 fps, and the timeline that is 60 fps. If you set Units to Index and the parameter value to 25, you get the image that is 1 second into the sequence. If you set the Units to Frames and set the value to 60 you get the same image at 1 second into the movie.
Index Unit `indexunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Index, Frames, Seconds, and Fraction (percentage).

Step Size `stepsize` - Sets how many frames to skip before displaying next frame. For example, a StepSize of 30 will display every 30th frame. The timing of the animation playback does not change, so with a Step Size of 30 and a sample rate of 30, a new frame will be displayed every second.
Audio Loop `audioloop` - ⊞ - This menu helps you determine how to treat the audio as the end of an animation approaches. This is needed because in some cases of playing an animation, like when driving with an index, the TOP will not know if you intend to loop it or not.

* Silence `silence` - Audio will go silent when the animation ends.

* Fade `fade` - Audio will fade out when the animation ends.

Image Sequence Indexing `imageindexing` - ⊞ - Determines how a file sequence is ordered.

* Zero Based `zero` - Index the sequence of files starting at 0, after sorting them alphanumerically.

* Filename Based `filename` - Index the sequence of files using the numbers on the end of the filenames. I.e a file named flower400.obj will be frame index 400, regardless of if there are other files in the directory before it.

Interpolate Frames `interp` - Interpolates between frames based based on exact time. For example, if the index (in frames) is 1.5, then frames 1 and 2 will be blended 50-50. If the index is 1.7 then 30% of frame 1 is blended with 70% of frame 2 and so on.
Loading/Error Image `loadingerrorimage` - ⊞ - When the file can not be loaded for some reason, select what to display instead.

* Colored Bottom Right Square `coloredbottomright` -

Extend Left `textendleft` - ⊞ - Determines how the Point File In TOP handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation's current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.

* Hold `hold` - Displays the first frame in the animation range (the frame specified by Trim Start) for any position before Trim Start.

* Mirror `mirror` - Loops the animation range in a zig-zag pattern. For example, playing backwards from Trim Start the animation will index will climb towards Trim End, at which point is will decend down towards Trim Start again and continue to zig-zag (or mirror) the further the animation plays backwards.

* Black `black` - Displays black frame for any animation position before Trim Start.

Extend Right `textendright` - ⊞ - Determines how the Point File In TOP handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation's current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the movie position is calculated.

* Hold `hold` - Displays the last frame in the animation range (the frame specified by Trim End) for any position after Trim End.

* Cycle `cycle` - Loops the animation range continuously.

* Mirror `mirror` - Loops the animation range in a zig-zag pattern. For example, playing forwards from Trim End the movie will index will start decending towards Trim Start, at which point is will start climbing towards Trim End and continue to zig-zag (or mirror) the further the animation plays.

* Black `black` - Displays black frame for any animation position after Trim End.

Pre-Read Frames `prereadframes` - Sets how many animation frames TouchDesigner reads ahead and stores in memory. The Point File In TOP will read and decode frames of the animation into CPU memory before they are used, this can eliminate pops or stutters in playback that occur from some frames taking too long to decode, other resources accessing the hard drive, or looping. When reading a sequence of files, having more Pre-Read Frames will allow multiple files to be decode at the same time. This allows playback of heavy file formats such as .exr in real-time, assuming the machine has enough CPU cores.
Frame Read Timeout `frametimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a frame from the hard drive before giving up. If the Disk Read Timeout time is reached, that frame is simply skipped. This also works for network files that are downloaded via http://.
Frame Timeout Strategy `frametimeoutstrat` - ⊞ - When on, if the Disk Read Timeout is reached TouchDesigner will use the latest available frame in place of the skipped frame.

Always Load Initial Frame `alwaysloadinitial` - If this parameter is turned on, then for the first loaded frame the Frame Read Timeout will be ignored, and it will always wait for the first frame to ensure the node always starts up with a valid image.
File Open Timeout `opentimeout` - The time (in milliseconds) TouchDesigner will wait for a file to open. If the Disk Open Timout is reached, the Point File In TOP will stop waiting and make its image all black, with a grey square in the bottom right corner. If the file still isn't opened the next time the TOP cooks, it'll wait again, and do the same. It'll keep doing this until the file is opened, or the open fails.
Async Upload to GPU `asyncupload` - When enabled, this will use OpenGL features to upload movie images to the GPU asynchronously. This will reduce the cook time of the Movie File In TOP considerably (in the performance monitor the lines that say "Uploading Image to GPU" will go down to almost nothing). There is a GPU memory cost to using this feature however. It uses up another (Width \* Height \* 4 \* Read Ahead Size) bytes of GPU memory. If you are having poor results with this feature, make sure your graphics drivers are up to date.
Update Image `updateimage` - Image will not update when set to 0. Animation index will continue to move forward but the output image will not update.
Max Decode CPUs `maxdecodecpus` - Limit the maximum number of CPUs that will be used to decode certain file codecs that are capable of multi-CPU decoding.
High Performance Read `highperfread` - This option should be used when playing back files that require very high SSD read speeds. It greatly improves read performance in those cases. It should not be used for low resolution or low data rate files.
High Performance Read Factor `highperfreadfactor` - When doing high performance reads, this parameter controls the size of the read operations that are done on disk. Whatever the largest operation the codec asks to be done, this is multiplied by the read factor and all subsequent reads will read that much data instead. This can result in higher throughput depending on the drives. For example if a request is made to read 1MB and the factor is set to 3, then instead the operations will read 3MB from the disk and the extra 2MB read will be ready for the next frame and will likely already have the next 2 frames available in CPU RAM.
Hardware Decode `hwdecode` - Controls if this node should use hardware decoding via the Nvidia hardware decoder chip. You can check if hardware decoding is being used using the Info CHOP, 'hardware\_decode' channel. This parameter does nothing for Hap and NotchLC codecs, which are always hardware decoded.

Extra Information for the Point File In TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Point File Select TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Point File Select TOP

The Point File Select TOP allows you to create additional output images from a point file loaded into a [Point File In TOP](Point_File_In_TOP.html "Point File In TOP"). This TOP is useful if your point data file has more than 4 channels e.g. XYZ position and RGB colors. It is more efficient to use a Point File Select TOP rather than a second [Point File In TOP](Point_File_In_TOP.html "Point File In TOP") since the file will only be loaded once.

Point SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Point SOP

The Point SOP allows you to get right into the geometry and manipulate the position, color, texture coordinates, and normals of the points in the Source, and other attributes. The Point SOP also lets you create custom point attributes. It is the complement to the [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP"). Using a second input allows for combining of two SOPs using their respective expressions (see: [PointSOP Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PointSOP_Class "PointSOP Class")). If the second input has less points than the first input, the points in the second input will be cycled.

For example, you can create point coloring, or flip the normals of incoming geometry. Using expressions in Position X, Y and Z, you can move any given input point to a new place as defined by the expression with any standard attributes.

The Width (width) attribute affects the line width in the [Line MAT](Line_MAT.html "Line MAT"). The Scale attribute (pscale) affects particle size, and in the [Line MAT](Line_MAT.html "Line MAT") it affects the dot size at each point.

**Tip**: For greater flexibility, use the [Script SOP](Script_SOP.html "Script SOP").

* X `vx` -

* Y `vy` -

* Z `vz` -

Up Vector `doup` - ⊞ - Creates/Removes the "up" attribute for points. This attribute defines an up vector which is used to fully define the space around a point (for particle instancing or copying geometry). The up vector can be used in conjunction with the copy template's normals to control the orientation of the copies in the [Copy SOP](Copy_SOP.html "Copy SOP").

* Keep Up Vector `off` -

* Add Up Vector `on` -

* Keep F Scale `off` -

* Add F Scale `on` -

* No F Scale `remove` -

F Scale `scalef` - If you select 'Add F Scale' from the menu above, scalef attribute will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions here to control the values of the force multiplier here. If you select 'No F scale' from the menu above, the scalef attribute will be removed from the SOP.
Radial F `doradialf` - ⊞ - Retains, adds, or removes radialf attributes for points, the force directed towards the attractor point. Positive multipliers are towards while negative are away.

* Keep Radial F `off` -

* Add Radial F `on` -

Enter expressions here to control the values of the force in the normal direction here. If you select 'No Normal F' from the menu above, the normalf attribute will be removed from the SOP.
Edge F `doedgef` - ⊞ - Retains, adds, or removes edgef attributes for points, which only works on primitive face types. The force is directed in the direction of the edge leading from that point. If multiple vertices reference the same point, then the direction is the edge direction of the last primitive referencing the point.

# Point Sprite MAT

The Point Sprite MAT allows you to control some attributes of Point Sprites (creatable using the [Particle SOP](Particle_SOP.html "Particle SOP"), [DAT to SOP](DAT_to_SOP.html "DAT to SOP"), or [Convert SOP](Convert_SOP.html "Convert SOP")). You can apply color, a color map, change the size of the created point sprite from a square to a rectangle, and scale the size of the point sprite.

A point sprite's final size controls the number of pixels wide/high it is, regardless of how far it is from the camera (unless you are using attenuation).

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[pointspriteMAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PointspriteMAT_Class "PointspriteMAT Class")

## Parameters - Point Sprite Page

Color `color` - ⊞ - The color of the light reflected from the material.

Alpha `alpha` - The opacity of the material. This parameter is multiplied by point alpha of the object.
Post-Mult Color by Alpha `postmultalpha` - Enable/disable multiplying color by alpha.
Color Map `colormap` - ⊞ - The color map to apply to the sprites. The Color Map will be multiplied by the color of the sprites. The Color Map parameter can also take 3D / 2D Texture Arrays (from the [Texture 3D TOP](Texture_3D_TOP.html "Texture 3D TOP") for example), and the w texture coordinate will select the correct map from the array.

The final size of the point sprite is controlled by the pscale point attribute (if present) getting multiplied of the result of the next 6 parameters. There are two types of scale this MAT can apply, and they are blended using the Attenuate Point Scale parameter to create one final point scale (which is multiplied by pscale).

Extend U `colormapextendu` - ⊞ -

Offset Left `offsetleft` - Crop the left side of the sprites.
Offset Right `offsetright` - Crop the right side of the sprites.
Offset Bottom `offsetbottom` - Crop the bottom side of the sprites.
Offset Top `offsettop` - Crop the top side of the sprites.
Constant Point Scale `pointscale` - A constant value that is applied to all points evenly. When Attenuate Point Scale is 0, the point sprite size will be pscale \* this value.
Attenuate Point Scale `attenpscale` - This value blends between the Constant Point Scale and the Attenuated Point Scale. 0 means 100% constant point scale and 1 means 100% attenuated point scale.

Points that are closer than or at the Near distance from the camera will use the Near Point Scale, points between the Near Distance and Far Distance will use a blended scale between the Near Point Scale and the Far Point Scale. Points farther than the Far Point Distance will use the Far Point Scale.

Attenuate Near Distance `attennear` - Points that are closer than or at this distance from the camera will use the Near Point Scale Parameter.
Attenuate Far Distance `attenfar` - Points that are farther than or at this distance from the camera will use the Far Point Scale Parameter.
Near Point Scale `attensizenear` - This point scale is applied at the near distance.
Far Point Scale `attensizefar` - This point scale is applied at the far distance.

Extra Information for the Point Sprite MAT can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Point Transform TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Point Transform TOP

The Point Transform TOP treats the RGB values of the input image as a point cloud of XYZ positions or vectors and performs 3D transformations and alignments. When the input type is set to 'Vector', translations are ignored and only rotation and scaling operations are performed. The alpha channel, if present, is passed along to the output image unchanged.

Transformations can be defined directly on the Transform page, taken from an input CHOP (see [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP")), using the Look At parameter, or as a combination of any of those methods.

The Align page allows you to move or scale the point cloud relative to the origin, a 1x1x1 cube, or to a reference object. For example, you can scale the cloud to fit inside another point cloud or piece of geometry, or you can align the point cloud to sit on the XZ plane, or directly beside another cloud.

The second input can optionally be used as a weight map to control how much of the transformation is applied to each individual point.

* [7 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [7.1 Common TOP Info Channels](#Common_TOP_Info_Channels)
  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Input Type `inputtype` - ⊞ - Choose if the RGB channels of the input texture should be treated as positions or vectors. Vectors will not have the translation portion of the transform applied to them, and can be normalized before and/or after the transformation is applied.

* Position `position` - The RGB values represent XYZ positions.

* Vector `vector` - The RGB values represent XYZ directions.

Normalize Input `innormalize` - RGB input vectors are rescaled to a length of one before they are transformed.
Normalize Output `outnormalize` - RGB vectors are rescaled to a length of one after they are transformed.
Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - Changes the order that the translate, rotate and scale operations are performed on the input. Analogous to how you would end up in different locations if you were to move a block and turn east, versus turning east and then moving a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T \* R \* S \* Position

Translate `t` - ⊞ - Move the input positions in the X, Y and Z axes. If the input is set to 'Vector', the translate values will have no effect.

* Translate `tx` -

* Translate `ty` -

* Translate `tz` -

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - Rotate the input RGB values around the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. Angles are given in degrees.

* Rotate `rx` -

* Rotate `ry` -

* Rotate `rz` -

Scale `s` - ⊞ - Scale the input RGB values in the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. If 'Normalize Output' is on, then all output values will be rescaled to a length of one regardless of the scale values.

* Scale `sx` -

* Scale `sy` -

* Scale `sz` -

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The pivot is the point about which the input points or vectors are scaled and rotated. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the object.

* Pivot `px` -

* Pivot `pz` -

Uniform Scale `scale` - Scale the input values along all axes simultaneously.
Invert `invert` - Invert the transformation i.e. preform the reverse movements.
Look At `lookat` - Allows you to orient your input points by naming the object you would like them to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this object to look at, it will continue to face that object, even if you move it.

Transform CHOP `chopinput` - Path to a CHOP node with channels describing a 3D transformation. These channels may come from a [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP") or another CHOP with the correct channels defined.
Multiply Order `multiplyorder` - ⊞ - Controls whether the transformation from the given CHOP is applied to the input values before or after the transformation describe by this node.

* Input, then Transform Page `inputxformpage` -

* Transform Page, then Input `xformpageinput` -

Weight Channel `weightchannel` - ⊞ - Select how to use the colors of the second input image as weights for transforming the points of the first input.

Weight Range `weightrange` - ⊞ - Set the range of weight values used to control how much of the transformation is applied to a point. Points with the minimum weight will **not** be transformed, while points with the maximum weight will be **fully** transformed. A linear interpolation is applied to points with weights that fall between the minimum and maximum.

* Weight Range `weightrange1` -

* Weight Range `weightrange2` -

These operations allow you to align the input points to the origin or to another reference object before or after the transformation has been applied. For example, you can recenter the transformed point cloud on the origin or position it directly next to another point cloud. **Note:** Align operations incur additional performance costs because they must calculate the dimensions of all points in the input.

Align Transform Order `alignxformorder` - ⊞ - Determines the order that align operations are performed on the input points. **Note**: Unlike Scaling on the transform page, the alignment scale is always done relative to the center of the point cloud so that the point cloud's center does not change.

* Transform, then Align `transformalign` -

* Align, then Transform `aligntransform` -

Reference Node `alignref` - A path to a TOP or SOP node used to align the input points after the transformation. **Note** Using another point cloud TOP as a reference will incur additional performance costs because of the need to calculate the dimensions of the reference points.
Align Operation Order `alignopord` - ⊞ - Set the order in which scale and transform is applied when aligning.

* Scale Translate `st` -

* Translate Scale `ts` -

* Max `max` - Points are aligned with the highest X value in the reference node.

Align Translate Y `alignty` - ⊞ - Determines the final position of points along the Y axis i.e. shifts values in the green channel.

* Off `off` - Y values are not moved.

Align Translate Z `aligntz` - ⊞ - Determines the final position of points along the Z axis i.e. shifts values in the blue channel.

* Off `off` - Z values are not moved.

Align Scale `alignscale` - ⊞ - The Align Scale can be used to resize the point cloud to fit inside the given bounds. Scaling can be done per axis (maintaining proportions or stretching), or on all axes.

* Per Axis `peraxis` - Scaling is controlled separately per-axis using the parameters below. **Note:** It is possible to have conflicting scales when setting limits on multiple axes.

* Unity `unity` - The point cloud is resized to fit within a 1x1x1 cube. Proportions are maintained so that the largest dimension will have a length of 1.

Align Scale X `alignscalex` - ⊞ - The point cloud is resized based on its width in the X axis.

* Off `off` - No scaling is done based on the X axis.

* Unity `unity` - The point cloud is resized along the X axis so that the total width is 1. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud.

* Reference Input `reference` - The point cloud is resized along the X axis to the width of the reference object. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud.

* Unity Proportional `unityprop` - The point cloud is resized so that the total width in the X axis is 1. Other axes are scaled accordingly to maintain proportions.

* Reference Proportional `referenceprop` - The point cloud is resized to match the width of the reference object. Other axes are scaled accordingly to maintain proportions.

* Unity Proportional `unityprop` -

Align Scale Y `alignscaley` - ⊞ - The point cloud is resized based on its height in the Y axis.

* Unity `unity` - The point cloud is resized along the Y axis so that the total height is 1. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud.

* Reference Input `reference` - The point cloud is resized along the Y axis to the height of the reference object. This does not affect the other axes and will distort the overall shape of the cloud.

* Unity Proportional `unityprop` - The point cloud is resized so that the total height in the Y axis is 1. Other axes are scaled accordingly to maintain proportions.

Polyloft SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Polyloft SOP

The Polyloft SOP generates meshes of triangles by connecting (i.e. lofting/stitching) the points of open or closed faces without adding any new points. Polyloft can also connect groups of unrelated points in a similar fashion. The faces and the point groups need not have the same number of points.

The optional input specifies the rest geometry, typically the copy of the main input at a specific face (usually 1). This forces the point order to remain constant throughout the animation and prevents the triangular stitch from popping as the geometry deforms. If you specify face or point groups for lofting using rest geometry, make sure they are defined in the second input.

# Polyreduce SOP

The Polyreduce SOP reduces a high detail polygonal model into one consisting of fewer polygons. The second input's polygons represent feature edges. They are matched to the input mesh by point numbers.

The methods to reduce polygonal models are:

* A percentage of their former size
* A specfic number of polys (within a few)
* According to distance from a camera

Note that as it requires (and outputs) a triangular mesh, the polygon count may increase as a result of this operation.

A second input for feature edges is provided.

* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Reduce Page

Polygons `reduce` - The polygons which will be candidates for simplification. Other polygons which share points with these might also be affected.
Features `creases` - Which polygons are feature edges.
Method `method` - ⊞ - Select how to reduce the number of polygons from the following methods.

* Percentage `percentage` - Choose reduction level with a percentage.

* Number `number` - Choose reduction level by number of polygons.

* Distance `distance` - Reduce polygons based on distance to an object.

Keep % `percentage` - Specify the percentage of polygons to keep when Method set to 'Percentage'.
Keep # `numpolys` - Specify the number of polygons to keep when Method set to 'Number'.
Object `obj` - The object to use as a reference.
Dist. Threshhold `distance` - The world distance at which the polygons should be left at full detail.
Minimum % `minpercent` - A lower bound to the level of reduction.

## Parameters - Clean Page

Stiffen Border `borderweight` - Without any constraints, the edges of planar surfaces can erode. This controls a bias which penalizes such erosion.
Stiffen Features `creaseweight` - The amount of penalty to add to the feature edges being eroded.
Equalize Edges `lengthweight` - This bias penalizes the removal of long edges. It tends to reduce high aspect ratio triangles at the expense of more uniform reduction.
Prevent Mesh Inversion `meshinvert` - When enabled, each reduction is tested to see if it would flip a triangle normal. While encurring a slight cost, the results are almost always worth it.
Pre-Triangulate `triangulate` - As only triangular polygons will be reduced, this option will automatically triangulate the input polygons.
Prevent Cracking `keepedges` - This prohibits the removal of any edge that occurs at the boundary of the polygons. This ensures no cracks develop with unreduced areas.
Use Original Points `originalpoints` - When it collapses edges, it will use one of the two original points instead of finding the optimal interior point.

# Polyspline SOP

The Polyspline SOP fits a spline curve to a polygon or hull and outputs a polygonal approximation of that spline. You can choose either to create divisions between the original points, or to ignore the position of the original points and divide the shape into segments of equal lengths.

Polyspline can optionally resample the output curve, providing control over the length and number of its segments.

**Tip:** When using this SOP, it is useful to enable Points display in the Viewport options dialog. This way you can see exactly what effect the SOP is having.

* Off `cnone` - Output spline open.

* On `calways` - Output spline closed.

* If polygon does `cifpoly` - Use the closure of the input face. In other words, Closed splines are created if the Source polygons are closed, open splines are created if the Source polygons are open.

Division Method `divide` - ⊞ - Settings for refining the spline by adding extra divisions.

* Standard `standard` - Do not resample curve.

* Even Length Segments `evenlen` - Ensure equal segment lengths.

* Even X Segments `evenx` - Ensure segments have equal length in X.

* Even Y Segments `eveny` - Ensure segments have equal length in Y.

* Even Z Segments `evenz` - Ensure segments have equal length in Z.

Segment Length `segsize` - The length of the segments in the resampled curve.

Division Method Standard
If Even Length Segments are selected, Segment Length sets the length of output segments. The number of output segments is determined by Output Divisions.
If Output Divisions is zero, the number of output segments is calculated using the Segment Length parameter, and is determined by how many segments of this size will fit into the overall shape.
If Even Length Segments is selected, along with zero Output Divisions and Segment Length of zero, an error message is generated, saying "Invalid number of divisions or segment size".

Output Divisions `polydivs` - Number of segments in the resampled curve.

If Division Method = Standard is selected, this has no effect. If Even Length Segments is selected, this parameter sets the number of edges that is created. The length of the segments is determined by Segment Length. If Segment Length is 0, the length of the output segments is determined by dividing the over all shape into this number of segments.

If the Output Divisions parameter is set to zero, the value of the Segment Length parameter is used to calculate the number of Output Divisions.

Sample Divisions `edgedivs` - Number of spline divisions before resampling.

If Division Method = Standard is selected, this is the number of subdivisions for every edge. If Even Length Segments is chosen, it has the subtle effect of determining the accuracy with which the segment lengths can be calculated.

First CV Count `first` - Number of times to repeat the first control vertex, determining its multiplicity. This determines the number of times to replicate the first vertex of the Source polygon(s). This is most useful when the Source consists of open polygons; extra vertices at the beginning of the line will force the curve to extend to the beginning of the line. For example a value of two will force a Cardinal curve to extend to its first vertex and a value of three will force a Bspline to start at is first vertex.
Last CV Count `last` - This determines the number of times to repeat the last control vertex, determining its multiplicity. This determines the number of times to replicate the last vertex of the Source polygon(s). This is most useful when the Source consists of open polygons; extra vertices at the end of the line will force the curve to extend to the end of the line.
CV Tension `tension` - The tension exerted by the points from the Source polygons. The greater the tension, the closer the resulting shape will be to the original shape.

Polystitch SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Polystitch SOP

The Polystitch SOP attempts to stitch polygonal surfaces together, thereby eliminating cracks that result from evaluating the surfaces at differing levels of detail.

First, the boundaries of all the polygons to be stitched are found. An edge is a boundary edge if it is shared by no other polygon. The uniqueness of edges is determined by point numbers, and not by spatial positioning. Each boundary is then split at each "corner" into a number of pieces. A list of corner points can be manually specified, or any point at which the boundary changes direction by a certain amount can be flagged as a corner.

Finally, any two boundary pieces that are within the tolerance of each other are stitched together. This is performed by snapping the points of the high detail edge to those of the low detail edge.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[polystitchSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/PolystitchSOP_Class "PolystitchSOP Class")

Polygons to Stitch `stitch` - The polygons to consider for stitching.
Corner Points `corners` - A list of point numbers that are to be considered breaks in the boundary edges.
Max Dist to Stitch `tol3d` - The maximum distance two edges can be from each other and still be stitched.
Consolidate Points `consolidate` - When several points along one edge are snapped to the same position, consolidate them into a single point. This only consolidates along the boundary, not across the boundary.
Automatically Find Corners `findcorner` - Whenever an edge changes direction at a point more than the specified angle, it will mark that point as a corner.
Corner Angle `angle` - The maximum angle a boundary point can change before it is considered a corner.

Position Class - Derivative

# Position Class

The position class holds a single 3 component position. A position is a single point in space, and it's important to use a position or [vector](Vector_Class.html "Vector Class") as appropriate for the data that is being calculated, since matrix operations on them will end in different results. When being multiplied by a [Matrix](Matrix_Class.html "Matrix Class"), this class will implicitly have a 4th component (W component) of 1. If the Matrix is a projection matrix that will cause the W component to become something other than 1, all 4 components will be divided by W to make the position homogeneous again. A new position can be created without any arguments, with 3 arguments for the x,y,z values, or with a single argument which is a variable that has 3 entries such as a list of length 3, or another position or vector.

Examples of creating a position:

```
p = tdu.Position() # starts as (0, 0, 0)
p2 = tdu.Position(1, 5, 0)
values = [0, 1, 0]
p3 = tdu.Position(values)

Prim Class - Derivative

# Prim Class

A Prim describes an instance to a single [geometry primitive](Primitive.html "Primitive"). They are accessible through the [SOP.prims](SOP_Class.html "SOP Class") member.

Retrieved from "<https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Prim_Class&oldid=31452>"
[Category](Special_Categories.html "Special:Categories"):

# Primitive SOP

The Primitive SOP is like the [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP") but manipulates a [primitive](Primitive.html "Primitive")'s position, size, orientation, color, alpha, in addition to primitive-specific attributes, such as reversing primitive normals. The Primitive SOP also lets you create custom primitive attributes.

You can also apply parametric affine transformations to a profile by using this SOP. You can also use it to open, close, reverse, and cycle the profile curves.

**Note:** When applying transformations to a profile, you can only rotate about the Z axis because the projected curve is a planar curve that lives in the domain of the surface. Therefore it wouldn't make any sense to allow rotations in X or Y for profiles.

### Transformation of Primitives vs Profiles

A Bezier surface is a single primitive, as is a NURBS surface, while a polygon mesh can consist of hundreds of individual primitives. Care must be taken to ensure the desired result. Profiles can be translated, rotated, and scaled along with 3D primitives. The Z component of translation and scaling is ignored. The X and Y components would be interpreted as U and V values because they apply to the space in which profiles are defined.

### Example - Mapping a Texture Inside a Sphere

There are many uses for the Primitive SOP. Normally, if you apply a texture onto a sphere, it is mapped onto the outside surface because the U surface normals point outwards by default. If you wanted to map the texture onto the inside of the sphere instead, you could simply run the sphere geometry through a Primitive SOP, and select Reverse U (i.e. the surface normals) in the Face/Hull page > Vertex menu.

Source Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. You can specify profile curves within the group by providing a profile pattern (e.g. \*.3 specifies the fourth profile in all spline surfaces).

**Tip:** By specifying both a primitive and a profile here (example: 0 0.\* ), you can affect a transformation of both the parent surface and a profile curve.

Template Group `templategrp` - A subset of template points to transform to.

Do Transformation `doxform` - When checked, allows transformations to occur.
Rotate to Template `dorot` - ⊞ - A template can be specified using the second input of the Primitive SOP. When set to On, this template can be used to transform each primitive to the location and orientation of the template point. This is similar to what the [Copy SOP](Copy_SOP.html "Copy SOP") does except that the actual primitives are transformed, not copies made.

* Off `off` - Don't rotate.

* On `on` - The primitive gets rotated as if its normal was (0,0,1), and is meant to point the same direction as the template normal.

* Match Normals `match` - Rotates the primitive so that its real normal lines up with the normal of the template point.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These three fields move the input geometry in the three axes. Profiles use tx and ty only.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - These three fields rotate the Source geometry in the three axes. Profiles use rz only.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - These three fields scale the Source geometry in the three axes. Profiles use sx and sy only.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The pivot point for the transformations. Profiles use px and py only.

Lookat Object `lookat` - Selects the object the primitive should point towards. This performs the lookat in object space; if you need to a lookat in world space, use the lookat in the object's Transform page instead.

**Tip:** In order to get multiple sprites to always be perpendicular to the camera, feed them into a Primitive SOP and specify the camera as your **Lookat Object**. Then the sprites should always be perpendicular to the camera.

Up-Vector `upvector` - ⊞ - Defines the orientation of the primitive along the X, Y, or Z axes.

The Up Vector determines how a primitive orients itself with respect to the target object (specified in Lookat Object). The default value is of 1 in the Y direction. This will produce nice behaviour if you want the object to rotate somewhat in the Z axis as the Lookat Object gets very close and/or passes the target. Scaling the Up Vector will cause the Lookat primitives to remain more upright as they get very close and/or pass the target. The stronger the Up Vector, the more the primitives will want to stay vertical and resist the rotation.

Color `doclr` - ⊞ - If Keep is selected, the color attribute is left unchanged. If Add is selected, this parameter changes the color of input primitives according to diffuse color field. If No is selected, the color attribute is removed.

Color `diff` - ⊞ - The color to add.

Alpha `alpha` - The alpha value to add.
Crease `docrease` - ⊞ - If Keep is selected, the crease attribute is left unchanged. If Add is selected, this parameter generates a crease attribute for the primitive. If No is selected, the crease attribute is removed.

* Keep Crease `off` -

* Add Crease `on` -

* No Crease `remove` -

Crease `crease` - Attribute is used to set edge crease weights for subdivision surfaces (see [Subdivide SOP](Subdivide_SOP.html "Subdivide SOP")). The Crease Weight attribute for a primitive sets all edges of the polygon to the value specified. On shared edges, the maximum of the two crease weights is used to define the sharpness of the subdivided surface. Crease weights should be larger than 0, with larger values defining sharper edges.
Custom Attrib `attr` - Sequence of custom attributes to be added to the geometry created.
Name `attr0name` - Creates a custom attribute with this name.
Size `attr0size` - ⊞ - The size of the attribute to create. It'll use however many values from the Value parameter as the size is.

Value `attr0value` - ⊞ - The value(s) to assign to the attribute.

* Value 1 `attr0value1` -

* Value 1 `attr0value2` -

* Value 1 `attr0value3` -

* Value 1 `attr0value4` -

## Parameters - Face/Hull Page

Preserve Shape U `pshapeu` - These options only become available once a type of clamping or closure has been selected.

**Closure** - Change the closure and clamping of a face or hull.

**Closure** - Change the closure and clamping of a face or hull. The options are:

Close U `closeu` - ⊞ - Close the primitive in U / V. Select from: Open, Closed Straight, Close Rounded, and Unroll. When you unroll a closed curve you duplicate the wrapped points (you make them unique) and turn the curve into an open curve. The shape of the curve does not change. Same goes for hulls, only there we unique entire rows and cols. This addresses a problem with texturing wrapped surfaces whereby the texture repeats itself in the wrapped portion of the surface.

* No change `sameclosure` -

* Open `open` -

* Close Straight `closesharp` -

* Close Rounded `closeround` -

* Unroll `unroll` -

Clamp U `clampu` - ⊞ - Clamp the primitive in U / V. Select from: Clamp, Unclamp.

* No change `sameclamp` -

* Clamp `clamp` -

* Unclamp `unclamp` -

Clamp V `clampv` - ⊞ - Clamp the primitive in U / V. Select from: Clamp, Unclamp.

Vertex `vtxsort` - ⊞ - Reorder the vertices in a number of ways.

* No change `samevertex` - Does not affect the ordering of the vertices.

* Reverse `reverse` - Reverses both U and V for hulls, and just U for faces.  
  **For example:**

* Reverse U `reverseu` - Reverses column order of hulls.

* Reverse V `reversev` - Reverses row order of hulls.

* Swap U and V `swapuv` - Interchanges rows/columns while preserving topology.

* Shift `shift` - Cycles the vertices by "U Offset" and "V Offset".

* Flip Face `flipfacing` -

U Offset `vtxuoff` - Cycles face or hull columns / rows when the Shift operation is selected.
V Offset `vtxvoff` - Cycles face or hull columns / rows when the Shift operation is selected.

## Parameters - Meta Page

Meta-Surface Weight `metaweight` - When selected, allows meta-surface weighting.
Weight `doweight` - Enter weight of meta-surface here when Meta-surface Weight is selected.

Particle Render Type `doprender` - When On the Particle Type menu below allows section of particle render type.

Profile SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Profile SOP

The Profile SOP enables the extraction and manipulation of profiles.

You will usually need a [Trim SOP](Trim_SOP.html "Trim SOP"), [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP"), or Profile SOP after a [Project SOP](Project_SOP.html "Project SOP"). Use a Trim SOP to cut a hole in the projected surface. Use a Bridge SOP to skin the profile curve to another profile curve.

  + [4.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Profile Page

Group `group` - This field allows you to specify the particular group of curves on the surface. Other primitives are ignored. You can specify profile curves within the group by providing a profile pattern (e.g. \*.3 specifies the fourth profile in all spline surfaces).
Method `method` - ⊞ - This menu allows you to extract a stand-alone 3D curve as the world or parametric image of the profile. The non-parametric option will yield a curve whose shape and position in space are identical or very similar to those of the chosen profile. The parametric option will produce a planar, XY face whose vertices and type will be identical to those of the profile in 2D; also, if the profile is a spline it will have the same basis as the extracted curve.

* Extract `extract` - Use the extraction parameters below to extract a 3D curve from the profile.

* Remap `remap` - Use parametric parameters below to produce a planar face from the profile.

Parametrically to X Y `parametric` - If Fitted (this option not checked), the profile will be a spatial NURBS curve whose position and shape in space will be identical to the curve on surface. It may very well be non-planar. If Extracted Parametrically (this option checked), the result will extract the profile's parametric image as a 3D face, which will be a planar face in XY whose type (polygon, Bzier, NURBS) will the same as the profile's, and whose vertices match the profile CVs. This, however, does not guarantee spatial coincidence between profile and extracted curve, and is more of an analytical tool.

**Tip:** A profile extracted parametrically can be reapplied to the surface identically with the Project SOP by choosing the **Parametric** option with no Mapping to Range. Use this method to extract the profile, pull its points or edit it as you would any 3D face, then re-project it on the surface at the same location.

Smooth Curve `smooth` - If enabled, it will fit a spline through the extracted points. This parameter is disabled when extracting the profile parametrically. Disable this parameter in order to bypass the fitting process which might be both expensive (in processing speed) and unnecessary when extracting profiles produced by boolean operations (see [Surfsect SOP](Surfsect_SOP.html "Surfsect SOP")).
Divisions per Span `sdivs` - The number of points per span to be computed on the profile. A span is the line connecting two consecutive CVs on a polygon, or the arc between two breakpoints on a spline curve. The profile tends to become more accurate as the number of divisions is higher.
Tolerance `tolerance` - This parameter specifies the precision of the fitting process for the extracted 3D data, and is typically less than 0.01.
Order `order` - The spline order of the resulting 3D curve. The type of curve (Bzier or NURBS) is inherited from the spatial curve. The order, however, is not inherited because the spline order provides useful control over the quality of the fit. If the profile is a polygon, the spatial curve will be a NURBS curve.
Preserve Sharp Corners `csharp` - Controls the precision with which sharp corners in the profile curve are interpolated. It should be on when the profile has areas of high changes in curvature.
Keep Surface `keepsurf` - Specifies whether the parent surface should be removed after the extraction or not.
Delete Original Profile `delprof` - When Keep Surface parameter is On, select whether to leave or delete the original profile.
Mapping Type `maptype` - ⊞ - Select how to reposition and scale an existing profile to fit within the specified domain range. It is a good means of bringing an invisible profile into view by setting the mapping range between 0 and 1 in the U and V parametric directions. A profile mapped outside the unit domain becomes invisible but is not removed from the surface. Other ways to change a profile are available through the [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP").

* Uniform `unif` - Uniform converts the spatial coordinates of the profile to (U,V) points in the domain of the surface without taking into account the parameterization of the surface.

* Chord Length `chordlen` - Chord Length takes into account the surface parameterization and attempts to compute a profile best suited to the spatial and parametric determinants of the model.

U Range `urange` - ⊞ - Indicates in percentages what part of the U surface domain is the mapping area. A full range of 0-1 will cause the profiles to be mapped to the entire domain in the U parametric direction. The range is not restricted to the 0-1 interval.

Project Class - Derivative

# Project Class

The Project class describes the current session. It can be accessed with the project object, found in the automatically imported [td module](Td_Module.html "Td Module"). Members changed in this such as the 'paths' member will be written to disk when the project is saved.

`folder` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The folder at which the project resides.

> The filename under which the project is saved.

`saveVersion` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The [App](App_Class.html "App Class") version number when the project was last saved.

`saveBuild` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The [App](App_Class.html "App Class") build number when the project was last saved.

`saveTime` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The time and date the project was last saved.

`saveOSName` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The [App](App_Class.html "App Class") operating system name when the project was last saved.

`saveOSVersion` → `str` **(Read Only)**:

> The [App](App_Class.html "App Class") operating system version when the project was last saved.

`paths` → `dict` **(Read Only)**:

> A dictionary which can be used to define URL-syntax path prefixes, enabling you to move your media to different locations easily. This dictionary is saved and loaded in the `.toe` file. Example: Run `project.paths['movies'] = 'C:/MyMovies'`, and reference it with a parameter expression: `movies://butterfly.jpg`. To manually convert between expanded and collapsed paths, use `tdu.collapsePath()` and `[tdu.expandPath](TDU_Class.html "TDU Class")`, for example `tdu.expandPath('movies://butterfly.jpg')` expands to `C:/MyMovies/butterfly.jpg`. If you already have your paths setup, choosing files from file browsers in OPs will create paths using these shortcuts rather than full paths. Additionally, to enable you to have different media locations on different machines, you can put a JSON file in the same folder as your `.toe` that gets read on startup. This will override any existing locations saved in projects.paths to the new machine specific file paths specified in the .json. Only existing entries in `project.paths` will be used. If the .json contains path names not specified in `project.paths`, those will be ignored. It would contain something like `{ "project.paths": { "movies": "M:/MyMovies" } }`. If your `.toe` file is called `MyProject.10.toe`, the JSON file must be called `MyProject.Settings.json`. The idea is that this .json would be unique to machines, and not commited to version control or shared between machines.

`cookRate` → `float` :

> Get or set the maximum number of frames processed each second. In general you should not need to use this. It is preferred to look at the FPS of the root component to know the cooking rate. Individual [components](COMP_Class.html "COMP Class") may have their own rates, specified by rate.
> 
> ```
> a = project.cookRate # get the current cook rate 
> project.cookRate = 30 # set the cook rate to 30 FPS
> 
> ```
> 
> Note: This is displayed and set in the user interface at the bottom-left: the "FPS" field.

`realTime` → `bool` :

> Get or set the real time cooking state. When True, frames may be skipped in order to maintain the cookRate. When False, all frames are processed sequentially regardless of duration. This is useful to render movies out using the Movie File Out TOP without dropping any frames for example.
> 
> ```
> a = project.realTime
> project.realTime = False # turn off real time playback.
> 
> ```

`isPrivate` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

`externalToxModifiedOnDisk` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> Callback for when an external tox file has been modified on disk.

`windowOnTop` → `bool` :

> Get or set the window on top state.

`windowStartMode` → `WindowStartMode` :

> Get or set the window start mode.
> The mode is one of: `WindowStartMode.AUTO`, `WindowStartMode.FULL`, `WindowStartMode.LEFT`, `WindowStartMode.RIGHT` or `WindowStartMode.CUSTOM`.

`windowStartCustomWidth` → `int` :

> Get or set the window start width. Only used when windowStartMode is `WindowStartMode.CUSTOM`.

`windowStartCustomHeight` → `int` :

Project SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Project SOP

The Project SOP creates curves on surface (also known as trim or profile curves) by projecting a 3D face onto a spline surface, much like a light casts a 2D shadow onto a 3D surface. There are two projection methods: along a vector, or by mapping the face directly onto the parametric space of the surface.

You will usually need a [Trim SOP](Trim_SOP.html "Trim SOP"), [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP"), or [Profile SOP](Profile_SOP.html "Profile SOP") after a Project SOP. For example, in the case of a Trim SOP we might have:

[![TouchGeometry146.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/4/41/TouchGeometry146.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry146.gif)

Use a Trim SOP to cut a hole in the projected surface (as shown above).

Use a Bridge SOP to skin the profile curve to another profile curve.

Use a Profile SOP to extract the curve on surface or remap its position.

If you end up with a profile curve that is not visible, it may still exist. Confirm a profile curve's existence by clicking on the SOP's info pop-up (using middle-mouse button).

### Additional Operations for Profile Curves

To delete a projected curve, use a [Delete SOP](Delete_SOP.html "Delete SOP"), and enter the profile number (e.g. 1.4 returns the fifth profile on the second primitive (counting starts at 0) ). You can visualise the number of the profiles by enabling the Profile Number icon in the Viewport Display options.

You can group the profile curves with a [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP"). Do this by typing the profile numbers in the Pattern field. You can use all regular expressions.

You can apply parametric affine transformations to the profile by using a [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP"). You can also use the Primitive SOP to open, close, reverse, and cycle the profile curves.

**Note:** When applying transformations to a profile in the Primitive SOP, you can only rotate about the Z axis because the projected curve is a planar curve that lives in the domain of the surface. Therefore it wouldn't make any sense to allow rotations in X or Y for profiles.

Face Group `facegroup` - The group of faces to be projected onto the spline surfaces. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Surface Group `surfgroup` - The group of surfaces to project faces onto. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Cycle Type `cycle` - ⊞ - Select the method use to project the 3D faces onto the 3D spline surfaces.

* All on Each Surface in Sequence `allseq` - If projected parametrically, the spatial relationship between the faces will be preserved. For example, if the text "hello" is projected parametrically and in sequence, the letters will appear on the surface naturally, side by side. Sequence is not applicable if projecting along a vector.

* All on Each Surface Overlapping `allover` - If projected parametrically, the spatial relationship between the faces is not preserved, so they will appear overlapped in the area of the domain chosen for projection. Overlapping is not applicable if projecting along a vector.

* One per Surface `oneeach` - Each face is projected onto a surface in the order in which the face and the surface appear in the input or in their respective groups.

* Cycled `cycled` - This is the same as One Per Surface, above, but starts the faces again if there are surfaces left.

Method `method` - ⊞ - Select between projecting along a vector or parametrically using the parameters below.

* Along Vector `vector` - The face is projected along a 3D vector and its image on the surface is converted into a curve on the surface. One spatial curve may generate several profiles depending on its position relative to the surface, the shape of the surface, and the chosen projection side. If the projected face does not intersect the surface at all, no profile curve will be generated.

* Parametrically `parametric` - The spatial size of the faces is mapped directly onto the domain of the spline surface. The resulting projection is sensitive to the parameterization of the surface and is likely to appear distorted. It is, however, the fastest of the two projection types and tends to behave well on surfaces with regular shapes and chord-length parameterizations.

Axis `axis` - ⊞ - The axis along which the four corners of the feature are projected onto the base. When adding the feature from the outside as a Vector paste.

* X `xaxis` - Cartesian axis X, Y, or Z.

* Y `yaxis` - Cartesian axis X, Y, or Z.

* Z `zaxis` - Cartesian axis X, Y, or Z.

* Face Normal `fnorm` - Projection axis occurs along each face's normal. Thus, each face could potentially have a different projection direction than the others. The option also works well for non-planar faces.

* Minimum Distance `mindist` - Projects the entire 3D face along the vectors of minimum distance to the surface. The projection resolution is given by the Divisions per Span value.

* User Defined: `other` - Enables the Vector fields immediately below to specify the X, Y, and Z components of the vector.

**Note:** When the **Minimum Distance** option is selected, the **Side** button becomes disabled because it's irrelevant for this projection type.

Vector `vector` - ⊞ - The X, Y, and Z components of the projection vector if none of the main axes is chosen in the Axis parameter above.

* `vector1` -

* `vector2` -

* `vector3` -

Side `projside` - ⊞ - Select which sides of the geometry to project on, closest or farthest.

* Closest `closest` - Will project the face onto the closest part of the surface in either direction of projection vector. For example, if a curve being projected onto a tube is inside the tube, it will yield two profiles, one on each side of the tube; if the curve is outside the tube, it will project onto the side closest to it.

* Farthest `farthest` - The reverse of Closest. In the example above, Farthest would also yield two images if the curve is inside the tube, but it will choose the farthest side if the curve is outside the tube.

Divisions per Span `sdivs` - The number of points to be computed on the spatial face between successive spans. A span is the line connecting two consecutive CVs on a polygon, or the arc between two breakpoints on a spline curve. The projection tends to become more accurate as the number of divisions increases.
Ray Tolerance `rtolerance` - Controls the precision of the ray intersection with the surface. The ray is cast along the projection vector from every point of the 3-D curve.
Fit Tolerance `ftolerance` - Controls the 2-D fitting precision and is typically less than 0.01.
Max UV Gap (%) `uvgap` - This specifies what percentage of the size of the surface domain is acceptable for two separate profiles to be joined into a single curve.
Order `order` - The spline order of the resulting profile curve. The type of curve (Bzier or NURBS) is inherited from the spatial curve. The order, however, is not inherited because the spline order provides useful control over the quality of the fit. If the spatial face is a polygon, the profile will be a NURBS curve.
Preserve Sharp Corners `csharp` - Controls the precision with which sharp corners in the projection curve are interpolated. It should be on when the projection has areas of high changes in curvature.
Super Accurate Projection `accurate` - Use a very accurate yet expensive algebraic pruning algorithm to determine the intersection of the vector with the surface.
U from `ufrom` - ⊞ - Specifies which of the spatial coordinates - X, Y, or Z - must be mapped to the U parametric direction of the surface.

* X Coordinate `uvx` -

* Y Coordinate `uvy` -

* Z Coordinate `uvz` -

V from `vfrom` - ⊞ - Specifies which of the spatial coordinates - X, Y, or Z - must be mapped to the V parametric direction of the surface.

Map Profile to Range: `userange` - This option is on by default. It causes the profile to be scaled and translated to fit within the surface's domain ranges described below. If this option is off, the profile's coordinates are mapped onto the surface domain without any transformation; consequently, the profile will not be visible if its points are not inside the domain of the target surface.

Typically, the projected face should not be mapped to the U/V range if it was previously extracted from the same surface using the [Profile SOP](Profile_SOP.html "Profile SOP") with the Parametrically to XY option selected.
The extraction and re-projection tandem can be very useful in achieving the modeling goals currently attainable only with 3D curves. Such tasks include the ability to edit the points of a profile, joining, stitching, or filleting profiles together, carving or refining profiles, etc. By extracting a profile parametrically to XY, Touch creates a 3D face that is identical to the 2D profile but has an additional (constant) Z component.

The resulting 3D curve can be modeled using all the 3D tools available. Finally, the modeled 3D face can be reapplied onto the surface parametrically, making sure that the range mapping option is off.

Mapping Type `maptype` - ⊞ - Select how to reposition and scale an existing profile to fit within the specified domain range.

* Uniform `unif` - Mapping converts the spatial coordinates of the projection faces to (U,V) points in the domain of the surface without taking into account the parameterization of the surface.

* Chord Length `chordlen` - Mapping takes into account the surface parameterization and attempts to compute a projection best suited to the spatial and parametric determinants of the model.

If the face is not mapped to range, it's vertices will be transferred to the profile without any transformation. Use this technique together with the parametric extraction in the Profile SOP to edit the points of a profile generated by a SOP other than Project: extract, edit the points, then project again.

### NURBS Scalp Patch for Hair

The: Along Vector > Axis > Minimum Distance option is extremely useful, say in the following situation: You have a NURBS surface of a head, and you want to obtain a NURBS patch by projecting a hairline onto the head's surface. You could:

Template the NURBS head.

Enter a [Model SOP](Model_SOP.html "Model SOP").

Enable the Snap to Template option in the Model Editor (Snap options).

Draw a NURBS curve along the surface of the head where you want the hairline. Then, with the Project SOP, you select the Minimum Distance option, and you have a profile curve with which you can trim the surface of the head to obtain the patch.

Thus having obtained a NURBS patch for the scalp, you could use it as the base for hair.

1. Place a [Circle SOP](Circle_SOP.html "Circle SOP") - Type: `NURBS`, Radius: `0.3, 0.3`; then place a [Tube SOP](Tube_SOP.html "Tube SOP") - Type: `NURBS`.
2. Connect them into a Project SOP - Circle to Input1; Tube to Input2.
3. Append a [Trim SOP](Trim_SOP.html "Trim SOP") to the Project SOP - it trims the surface according to the projection provided by the Project SOP. You need to append a Trim SOP to a Project SOP in order to realise this trimming action.
4. Enable the template flags on the Circle and Tube SOPs; make the Project SOP the display SOP.

Projection TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Projection TOP

The Projection TOP takes an image, often created with a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"), in a [Cube Map](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cube_Map "Cube Map"), Equirectangular, Fish Eye or Dual Paraboloid format, and converts that to a Fisheye or Equirectangular projection suitable for domes, or a Cube Map format. For Equirectangular images, u-v horizontal-vertical is the latitude-longitude, suitable for spheres. This produces superior-quality when it's based on the cube maps.

For every pixel of output, it takes one sample from the input cube map. Better anti-aliasing may be achieved by rendering double-resolution and scaling down to your desired resolution with the High Quality Resize option of the [Resolution TOP](Resolution_TOP.html "Resolution TOP")

When converting to a Equirectangular image, it is recommended you set the output resolution to a 2x1 aspect ratio, like 4096x2038. Fish Eyes are best output as a 1x1 aspect ratio.

* Fish-Eye `fisheye` -

* Dual Paraboloid `dualparaboloid` -

Output `output` - ⊞ - Select output format from the menu.

* Equirectangular `equirectangular` - A 2D Texture is usually 2:1 aspect ration. This format is typically used to map the texture onto a sphere with UVs set to to lat/long. This format is very popular for 360 video. A more details explanation is available [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection).

* Fish-Eye `fisheye` - A projection where the image takes up a circle in the 2D texture(with the corners of the texture being black). The circle contains image data that is 'FOV Angle' degrees wide across the diameter of the circle.

FOV Angle `fov` - Only enabled in Fish-Eye output mode to specify the field of view of the Fish-Eye camera.
Rotate `r` - ⊞ - Use this parameter to rotate the map on any axis.

# Pulse CHOP

The Pulse CHOP generates pulses in one channel at regular intervals. The amplitude of each pulse can be edited with the CHOP sliders or with handles on the graph.

The Pulse CHOP gives a set of pulses in a static channel of a specifiable length.

See also the [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html "LFO CHOP") to get an endless stream of pulses that is [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)"), and the [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP") for a string of static pulses.

The Pulse CHOP can be used as triggers to the [Copy CHOP](Copy_CHOP.html "Copy CHOP"), and can represent regularly-timed events.

By default, the pulses are a single sample long, but you can increase the Pulse Width so that the pulses are steps to the next pulse. You can also interpolate the values between pulses, as Linear, Ease In Ease Out, Cubic or other curves.

The pulses can be restricted to a minimum / maximum limit. If the Limit Type is Clamp, the graph has additional convenient handles at the minimum and maximum for each pulse.

The Pulse CHOP generates a single channel, and you can merge several Pulse CHOPs into a multi-channel CHOP.

The Pulse CHOP uses its optional first input as a start/end reference, so a number of Pulse CHOPs can be stretched to the same interval.

The optional second input is used to specify pulses at specific sample locations. Every single-sampel input channel is then interpreted as the location of a pulse.

In order to set the value at the last sample, the option, Last Pulse at Last Sample is provided. Otherwise, the last pulse is prior to the last sample.

## Parameters - Pulse Page

Number of Pulses `number` - The number of pulses to generate.
Interpolate `interp` - ⊞ - You can interpolate the values between pulses using the following function curves:

* Off `nointerp` - Disables interpolation.

* Linear (Ramp) `linear` - Use linear interpolation between samples when the interval is lengthened. Averages all samples near the new sample when the interval is shortened.

* Ease in `easein` - Uses an easein() function for blending.

* Ease out `easeout` - Uses an easeout() function for blending.

* Ease in Ease out `cosine` - Uses both easein() and easeout() functions.

* Cubic `cubic` - Cubically interpolates between samples, for smoother curves than Linear. This method is not recommended for channels with sharp changes.

* Connect `connect` - Instead of the pulses returning to 0, the pulse value is held until the pulse.

Pulse Width `width` - By default, the pulses are a single sample long, but you can increase the Pulse Width so that the pulses are steps to the next pulse.
Pulse Width Unit `widthunit` - ⊞ - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

Limit Type `limit` - ⊞ - Enable the Minimum and Maximum clamping values below with this menu.

* Off `nolimit` - Pulses are allowed to be any value with no clamping.

* Clamp `clamp` - Clamps pulse values to the Minimum and Maximum values specified below.

Minimum `min` - The pulses can be restricted to a Minimum limit. If the Limit Type is Clamp, the graph has additional convenient handles at the minimum for each pulse.
Maximum `max` - The pulses can be restricted to a Maximum limit. If the Limit Type is Clamp, the graph has additional convenient handles at the maximum for each pulse.
Minimum Spacing `minspacing` - When creating pulses via the second input, the Minimum Spacing parameter will separate out pulses from each other with the minimum distance specified here. The unit of the spacing is controlled by the Pulse Index Unit parameter.
Cascade when Spacing `cascade` - When minimum spacing between pulses is enabled, cascading will shift pulses by the amount of samples added via the minimum spacing.

Quaternion Class - Derivative

# Quaternion Class

Holds a Quaternion object which can be used to manipulate rotations in various ways. Quaternions can be constructed using a few different ways to describe the initial rotation:

# From Euler Angles, rx, ry, rz in degrees
q = tdu.Quaternion(30, 5, -5)
q = tdu.Quaternion([30, 5, -5])

# From an angle and a rotation axis
q = tdu.Quaternion(30, tdu.Vector(0, 1, 0))

# From two vectors, rotate from the first vector to the 
second vector
q = tdu.Quaternion(tdu.Vector(1, 0, 0), tdu.Vector(0, 1, 0))

# From a set of 4 quaternion values
q = tdu.Quaternion(x, y, z, w)
q = tdu.Quaternion([x, y, z, w])

# From a Matrix
q = tdu.Quaternion(tdu.Matrix())

# From a quaternion
q = tdu.Quaternion(tdu.Quaternion())

Quaternions can be used like simple Python lists:

```
print(q[1])		# same as q.y
q[2] = 0		# same as q.z

See also [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP") which accepts, manipulates and outputs quaternions as sets of CHOP channels.

# Rails SOP

The Rails SOP generates surfaces by stretching cross-sections between two rails. This is similar to the [Sweep SOP](Sweep_SOP.html "Sweep SOP"), but it gives more control over the orientation and scaling of the cross-sections. The first SOP input is the cross-section which will be replicated, and is typically placed in the XY plane. The second input SOP source is the rails along which the cross-section is replicated.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[railsSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/RailsSOP_Class "RailsSOP Class")

X-Section Groups `xsectgrp` - You can use a subset of primitives from the Cross-section input by specifying a group here. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Rail Groups `railgrp` - You can use a subset of primitives from the Rails input by specifying a group here. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Cycle Type `cycle` - ⊞ - Select how the cross=section is applied along the rails.

* All Primitives at Each Point `all` - Places all the primitives from the Cross-section input at each point on the backbone.

* One Primitive at a Time `each` - Similar to the above, except the transformation is applied to individual primitives rather than to the whole.

* Cycle Primitives `cycle` - This cycles through incoming primitives when placing them on a backbone. i.e. Start with 0 at vertex 0, primitive 1 at vertex 1, etc.

Sweep along Pairs of Rails `pairs` - Sweeps along rail 1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6 etc. instead of 1 & 2, 2 & 3, 3 & 4 etc.
Sweep along First and Last Rail `firstl` - Connects the cross-section between the first and last rails.
Stretch to Rails `stretch` - Stretches the cross-section geometry to the rail geometry.
Use Vertex `usevtx` - Specifies two vertices of the cross section polygon to be placed on rail1 and rail2 respectively. Very useful, for instance, to keep the first vertex on rail1 and the seventh vertex on rail2.
Connection Vertices `vertex` - ⊞ - The vertices at which the cross-section is connected to the rails.

* `vertex1` -

* `vertex2` -

Scale `scale` - Global scaling of the cross-sections.
Roll `roll` - Non-cumulative rotation of the cross sections around the backbone. All cross sections get the same rotation.
Fix Flipping `noflip` - Option to correct the flipping when no direction vector is used and the two rails happen to cross each other causing the normal to flip upside down.
Use Direction `usedir` - Uses the direction vector specified in the X, Y and Z coordinates. Otherwise it will use the normals of the geometry.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - The direction vector to use.

Create Output Groups `newg` - Selecting this option enables the creation of groups. A group is created for each backbone that is incoming. This allows for easy skinning in the [Skin SOP](Skin_SOP.html "Skin SOP").
Group Name `railname` - Specify the name of your output groups in this field. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

Extra Information for the Rails SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Ramp TOP

The Ramp TOP allows you to interactively create vertical, horizontal, radial, and circular ramps. Using the ramp bar and the color picker, you can add as many color tabs to the ramp as you like, each with its own color and alpha values. Click on a color tab to select it and change its color. Click elsewhere on the ramp bar to add another color keyframe. Drag a color tab off the ramp bar to delete it.

The data for each color keyframe in the ramp is held in the [DAT](DAT.html "DAT") specified by the DAT parameter. Each row in this DAT (in [Table Format](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT")) represents a color keyframe entry in the ramp. The first column is the color keyframe's position on the ramp, the range is 0-1. The next 4 columns are the RGBA value for the color keyframe at that position. The DAT can be edited directly and the ramp will update in real-time.

# Raster SOP

The Raster SOP converts TOP image data to geometry by scanning left to right, top to bottom, outputting a geometry point at each pixel. This output can be used to display image data on laser devices, oscilloscopes or similar devices using the [Laser CHOP](Laser_CHOP.html "Laser CHOP"). This is different from the [Trace SOP](Trace_SOP.html "Trace SOP") which only outputs contour shapes from an image.

# Ray SOP

The Ray SOP is used to project one surface onto another. Rays are projected from each point of the input geometry in the direction of its normal. This can be used to drape clothes over surfaces, shrink-wrap one object with another, and other similar effects.

* [4 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Method `method` - ⊞ - Select the method of projection for the Ray SOP.

* Minimum Distance `minimum` - Points are placed on the closest point on the collision geometry. This method does not use point normals. Use it to shrinkwrap or project one primitve onto another.

* Project Rays `project` - Points are projected along their normals until intersecting with collision geometry.

Transform Points `dotrans` - If selected, it will transform the input points as defined below. Leave this off when only interested in updating the source point attributes.
Intersect Farthest Surface `lookfar` - If selected, this option allows the user to choose between intersecting with the closest intersecting object or the furthest. See example, below.
Point Intersection Normal `normal` - ⊞ - If selected, updates each point in the source geometry with the normal at the collision surface it intersects with. If the point doesn't intersect at the collision surface, a normal of (0,0,0) is used.

* Source Normal `source` -

* Collision Normal `collision` -

* Reflected Ray `reflect` -

Bounces `bounces` - The number of times to bounce the ray off of the collision surface before creating the output position. For example, if bounces is set to 1, then the point will be projected onto surface at the first point it hits. If set to 2, the ray will be re-projected off of that first surface as if it was reflected, or bounced and will then be projected onto the next surface the ray hits. See the second Ray snippet for an example.
Save Bounce Geometry `bouncegeo` - When enabled, the projected geometry will be saved each time the projected ray bounces off a surface resulting in multiple copies of the input geometry. See the second Ray snippet for an example.
Point Intersection Distance `putdist` - If selected, updates each point intersected with the distance to the collision surface. If the point doesn't intersect at the collision surface a distance of 0 is used. This value is placed in the `$DIST` point attribute, accessible from the [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP").
Scale `scale` - A value of zero will leave the input point unaffected. A value of one will land the point on the intersection surface. Negative values and values > 1 are also valid.
Lift `lift` - This value further offsets the surface input by offsetting it in the direction of its normal.
Sample `sample` - This value determines the number of rays sent per point. If greater than one, the remaining rays are perturbed randomly, and averaged.
Jitter Scale `jitter` - Controls the perturbation of the extra sample rays.
Seed `seed` - Allows a different random sequence at higher sampling rates.
Create Point Group `newgrp` - If selected, it will create a point group containing all the points which were intersected successfully.
Ray Hit Group `hitgrp` - Specifies the name of the above point group.

1. Place a [Grid SOP](Grid_SOP.html "Grid SOP") and translate it in TZ by 2.5. Turn it's template flag on.
2. Append a Point SOP to the Grid and enable the Create Point Normals option.
3. Place a NURBS Sphere with a Radius of 2,2,2 and translate it in Z by -2.5 .
4. Display point normals by enabling the option in the Viewport > Display Options.
5. Append a Ray SOP to the Point SOP and connect the Sphere to the right input. Make it the display SOP.
6. Toggle the Intersect Farthest Surface button on and off.

The Ray SOP will move the points of the Grid in the direction of the point normals. The first surface of the Collision Source (right input) will be where those points of the grid will rest. You can make those points rest on the other side of the sphere by enabling the Intersect Farthest Surface option. This means that the points should continue to project to the farthest surface of the collision source.

RealSense CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# RealSense CHOP

**DEPRECATED:** Skeleton tracking features no longer licensable by Cubemos.
[RealSense](RealSense.html "RealSense") is a tracking device from Intel. The RealSense CHOP references a [RealSense TOP](RealSense_TOP.html "RealSense TOP") camera and fetches tracking data from it. The RealSense CHOP supports skeleton tracking through the [Cubemos Skeleton Tracking API](https://www.intelrealsense.com/skeleton-tracking/). [Cubemos](https://docs.derivative.ca/Cubemos "Cubemos") is Windows only. A Cubemos license is required to use the skeleton tracking.

#### Skeleton Tracking Setup

The RealSense CHOP supports skeleton tracking through the [Cubemos RealSense Skeleton Tracking API](https://www.intelrealsense.com/skeleton-tracking/). The Cubemos API requires a license to use in TouchDesigner. A full license can be purchased [here](https://www.intelrealsense.com/skeleton-tracking); a trial license is also available. Installing their SDK is required to setup the license file. After installation of the SDK, the license can be setup with the `post_installation.bat` script in the `C:/Program Files/Cubemos/SkeletonTracking/scripts` folder. A model file (`.cubemos`) is also required for the skeleton tracking, two of which are packaged with the Cubemos Skeleton Tracking SDK, located in their `Cubemos/SkeletonTracking/models/skeleton-tracking` folder.

**NOTE:** The [librealsense SDK v2.50.0](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/releases) does not look like it will be updated for Apple Silicon, so it is not an option to add to these builds.

Record CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Record CHOP

The Record CHOP takes the channels coming in the first (Position) input, converts and records them internally, and outputs the stored channels as the CHOP output. The optional second (Active) input is used to enable and disable the recording.

During recording, the Record CHOP uses only the values of the first input at the current frame. The Type determines how the input values are converted.

**Tip**: The [Trail CHOP](Trail_CHOP.html "Trail CHOP") also records the last window of samples, and more powerfully, the gestureCapture component in the Palette gives more control over multi-captures and smoothing channel data.

If Record is set to Auto Range, and the Active input goes on, and TouchDesigner is playing, then any existing storage array is cleared, and the channels are recorded in a new storage array until Active goes off. This behaves like a sampler.

The [Mouse In CHOP](Mouse_In_CHOP.html "Mouse In CHOP") and [Keyboard In CHOP](Keyboard_In_CHOP.html "Keyboard In CHOP") are often attached to the Position and Active inputs respectively of the Record CHOP to perform the recording of channels from mouse movements, enabled by pressing a keyboard key (see the [Keyboard In CHOP](Keyboard_In_CHOP.html "Keyboard In CHOP")).

Record Segment is useful for recording trails, snakes, and other models that use a time-history of motion.

See the [Time Slice CHOP](Time_Slice_CHOP.html "Time Slice CHOP") for input smoothing.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[recordCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/RecordCHOP_Class "RecordCHOP Class")

Record `record` - ⊞ - When and how much to record:

* Off `off` - Leaves the output unmodified.

* On `on` - Always records when playing forward. When the active input is in the off state the input is maintained at its current values.

* Add `add` - Adds (offsets) to an existing set of channels previously recorded in the Record CHOP. The channels are left unmodified while the Active input is in the off state.

* Auto Range `auto` - Creates an interval based on Active on/off.

Record Input `sample` - ⊞ - Determines whether record should sample the time slice or the current frame. You would generally want to use Current Time Slice, for audio, as all frames will be evaluated.

If the interval is set to be the Current Frame, it will always cook (only look at) the current frame (things downstream still cook regardless of this setting however). Thus, it should generally not be used for audio, but rather fro things like device input, because it interpolates the values between the captured frames.

* Current Time Slice `sslice` -

Interpolation `interp` - ⊞ - Determines how to compute missed input samples using interpolation. Using Hold Previous Value does just that; Linear and Cubic interpolation will create a mathematical blend of values in a linear (straight line between values in time), or cubic (smooth round-off curve between beginning and ending values).

* Hold Previous Value `hold` -

Record Output `output` - ⊞ - Determines the frame range that gets output from the CHOP.

* Full Range `full` - The frame range grows from the moment and frame you start recording. Samples get recorded over when TouchDesigner goes over a frame a second time. Press Reset Channels to start again.

* Current Frame `curframe` - Outputs the current frame only.

* Current Frame at Frame 1 `frame1` - Outputs the current frame but shifts it to frame 1. If the channels are not changing value, it reduces the amount of cooking that takes place.

* Current Time Slice `slice` - Outputs the current [Time Slice](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") of samples only.

* Segment `segment` - Outputs a sliding window of samples defined by the Record Segment start/end length.

Record Segment `segment` - ⊞ - The data gets recorded in a fixed-range interval and the most recent data gets recorded at the end of the interval and the remaining samples get shifted toward the start of the interval. This is useful for making snakes.

* `segment1` -

* `segment2` -

Record Segment Unit `segmentunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Reset Channels `reset` - The current output is cleared and all subsequent channels will commence single sample lengths.
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - Enabled when a CHOP is connected to the Record CHOP's 3rd input (ie. Input 2). Determines what condition is required to trigger a reset using this input.

* Off to On `offtoon` - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from Off to On ie. 0 to 1.

* While On `on` - Resets the recording when the input channel is On ie. 1.

* On to Off `ontooff` - Resets the recording when the input channel goes from On to Off ie. 1 to 0.

* While Off `off` - Resets the recording when the input channel is Off ie. 0.

Extra Information for the Record CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# Rectangle SOP

The Rectangle SOP creates a 4-sided polygon. It is a planar surface. The rectangle can be explicitly sized, or sized from other sources such as at the camera's view frustum, or the bounding box of a SOP connected to this node's input.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[rectangleSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/RectangleSOP_Class "RectangleSOP Class")

Orientation `orient` - ⊞ - Picks the major plane the rectangle's y-axis orients itself with. Set it to camera if it is to point towards a camera.

* XY plane `xy` -

* YZ plane `yz` -

* ZX plane `zx` -

* Fill Camera View `cam` -

Camera `camera` - Specifies which camera to use if Orientation is set to camera.
Camera Z `camz` - Used when using 'Fill Camera View'. Camera Z is an arbitrary distance you specify from the camera. It will move the rectangle so it is this many units away from the camera, then scale the rectangle so it fills the viewer.
Camera Aspect `cameraaspect` - ⊞ - Specify the aspect ratio of the camera with this parameter and the Restangle SOP's aspect ratio will match. This makes it easy to apply a texture on the rectangle which matches the camera's viewport without any further adjustments.

* X `cameraaspectx` -

* Y `cameraaspecty` -

Modify Bounds `modifybounds` - If a SOP is connected to the node's input, then the rectangle will be sized based on the bounding box of that SOP. Enabling Modify Bounds allows the resulting rectangle to be further modified by scaling it's size or moving it's center.
Size `size` - ⊞ - Adjusts the size of the rectangle in X and Y. If the size of the rectangle is being chosen from a Camera, or from a connected input SOP, then this parameter behaves as a scale. Otherwise it will set the size of the rectangle for all other modes.

Center `t` - ⊞ - These X, Y, and Z Values determine where the center of the Rectangle is located. If the position of the rectangle is being chosen from a Camera, or from a connected input SOP, then this parameter behaves as an offset. Otherwise it will set the center of the rectangle for all other modes.

Reverse Anchors `reverseanchors` - Invert the direction of anchors.
Anchor U `anchoru` - Set the point in X about which the geometry is positioned, scaled and rotated.
Anchor V `anchorv` - Set the point in Y about which the geometry is positioned, scaled and rotated.
Texture Coordinates `texture` - ⊞ - Texture addes (0,1) coordinates to the vertices when set to Face. Creates a rectangle without uv attributes when set to Off.

* Face `face` -

Compute Normals `normals` - Create a normal (N) attribute for this geometry.

Extra Information for the Rectangle SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Refine SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Refine SOP

The Refine SOP allows you to increase the number of CVs in any NURBS, Bzier, or polygonal surface or face without changing its shape. It is also used to decrease the number of CVs within a given tolerance (i.e. a simple but fast method of data reduction).

### The Difference Between Refinement and Unrefinement

Refinement and unrefinement work both on faces (polygons, Bzier curves and NURBS curves) and surfaces (primitive meshes, Bzier surfaces and NURBS surfaces). To unrefine a face or a surface you need to specify a parametric interval (not just a single value as in refinement). This allows you to unrefine primitives within arbitrary intervals, either locally or globally. For example, to unrefine the whole primitive choose 0 and 1 as the two parametric boundaries; [0,0.5] will unrefine only the first parametric half of the primitive.

The interval boundaries are given by the First/Second U/V fields. Since refinement does not need an interval, the Second U/V fields are disabled by default.

The Tolerance control is only available for unrefinement, and not for refinement. Refinement does not need tolerances because it generates a curve or a surface that is mathematically identical to the original. Unrefinement, however, may tend to smooth out (or "melt") the original in a given area. In short, unrefinement is lossy; refinement isn't.

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
First U `firstu` - Enable or disable the First U controls.
First U `domainu1` - This specifies a starting / ending location to complete the operation. Select this and a parametric U location between 0 and 1.
Second U `secondu` - Enable or disable the Second U controls.
Second U `domainu2` - This specifies a starting / ending location to complete the operation. Select this and a parametric U location between 0 and 1.

V Divisions `divsv` - If refining or sub-dividing, this option specifies the number of refines to be performed between First V and Second V.

## Parameters - Refine Page

If enabled, will refine the primitive at the locations specified above. If the primitive is a NURBS, then a knot is inserted multiple times as described below.

NURB Count U `refineu` - Number of knots to insert at each location in the U / V basis when refining NURBS.
NURB Count V `refinev` - Number of knots to insert at each location in the U / V basis when refining NURBS.
Spacing `space` - ⊞ - Specify how to measure along splines / curves.

* Uniform Domain Lengths `domain` - Refine at equal basis intervals if refining a spline.

* Uniform Arc Lengths `arc` - Each refinement is done at the centre of the maximum knot span (splines) or edge length (polygons).

**Note:** **Uniform Domain Lengths** should be selected if the domain ranges are animating, otherwise the inserted points will be undeterminable as different maximum lengths are encountered.

## Parameters - Unrefine Page

If enabled, will remove CVs from any NURBS curve or surface, polygon or mesh (points/ rows removed) between First U and Second U, and First V and Second V.

NURB Count U `unrefineu` - Number of knots to remove at each location in the U / V basis if refining NURBS.
NURB Count V `unrefinev` - Number of knots to remove at each location in the U / V basis if refining NURBS.
Tolerance U `tolu` - Only remove knots that do change the curve, polygon, or surface by more than this distance.
Tolerance V `tolv` - Only remove knots that do change the curve, polygon, or surface by more than this distance.

## Parameters - Subdivide Page

Subdivide refines a primitive such that the subdivision causes a sharp discontinuity if ever displaced. In essence subdivide is equivalent to refine for polygons and Bziers, since any refinement causes a potential discontinuity. In the case of a NURBS it is equivalent to a maximum refinement (i.e. count = primitive basis order - 1).

Spacing `subdivspace` - ⊞ - Subdivide refines a primitive such that the subdivision causes a sharp discontinuity if ever displaced. In essence subdivide is equivalent to refine for polygons and Bziers, since any refinement causes a potential discontinuity. In the case of a NURBS it is equivalent to a maximum refinement (i.e. count = primitive basis order - 1).

Remap TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Remap TOP

The Remap TOP uses the second input to warp the first input. For every pixel of the output, it uses the red channel and green channel of the second input to choose which pixel to pick from the first input. Red == 0 will pick from the left column of pixels, red == 1 will pick from the right column of pixels. Green == 0 will pick from the bottom row of pixels, green == 1 will pick from the top row of pixels. Red == .5 and green == .5 will pick from the middle pixel of the first input. Pixels from the first input are interpolated.

It is best that the second input contain a 16-bit-per-channel image or better, like 32-bit floats. Otherwise if the second input is 8-bits per color channel, the output images will have jagged edges as there are only 256x256 pixels from the first input that will be sampled. See the Pixel Format parameter on the Common page of the TOP connected to the Remap TOP's second input, and check its current pixel format settings with the MMB Info popup on the TOP.

Note: The [Displace TOP](Displace_TOP.html "Displace TOP") does the same thing if you set the Vertical Source to Green the UV Weight parameter set to 0, and the Displace Weight set to .5. The Displace TOP does more general warping, whereas the Remap TOP is often used for warping images with other tools like the Stitcher component in the [Palette](Palette.html "Palette"), or for projection mapping.

# Rename CHOP

The Rename CHOP renames channels. Channels names from the input CHOP are matched using the From pattern, and are renamed to the corresponding name in the To pattern. Channels that do not match the From pattern are not affected.

It uses [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") on the From string, and [Pattern Replacement](Pattern_Replacement.html "Pattern Replacement") on the To string.

The channel values and the channel order are not affected, only their names change.

(Note that the [Constant CHOP](Constant_CHOP.html "Constant CHOP") (containing channel values of 0) added to another CHOP in a [Math CHOP](Math_CHOP.html "Math CHOP") can also be used to rename channels.)

See also [Select CHOP](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP")

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[renameCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/RenameCHOP_Class "RenameCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Rename Page

The optional second input CHOP (Name Reference) names the first CHOP's channels to be the same as the second CHOP's channels, in the order they appear. In this case, From and To are ignored.

From `renamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
To `renameto` - The replacement pattern for the channel names. See [Pattern Replacement](Pattern_Replacement.html "Pattern Replacement").

# Render Pass TOP

The Render Pass TOP is used along with a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") to achieve multipass rendering. It can build upon its inputs render by using the existing depth/color information in the framebuffers, or it can optionally clear one or both of the depth/color buffers before it does its render.

## Parameters - Render Pass Page

Render/RenderPass TOP `renderinput` - The network path to the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") used as input. This parameter can be used as an alternate to connecting a Render or Render Pass TOP to the Render Pass's input connector. Makes it easier to select a render from another network.
Camera `camera` - Specifies which [Cameras](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") to look through when rendering the scene.
Geometry `geometry` - Specifies which [Geometry](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") will be included in the rendered scene. You can use [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") to specify objects using patterns. Example: `geo* ^geo7` will render all Geometry components whose names start with `geo` except `geo7`.
Lights `lights` - Specifies which [Lights](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") will be used to render the scene. You can use [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") here as well.
Clear to Camera Color `cleartocamcolor` - Clears the values that are currently in the color buffer (coming from the TOP that is wired to the input of this node).
Clear Depth Buffer `cleardepth` - Clears the values that are currently in the depth buffer (coming from the TOP that is wired to the input of this node).
Positive Sides `posside` - ⊞ - When Render Mode is Cube Map, specify which sides if the cube map are rendered, +X, +Y, or +Z.

* Positive Sides `possidex` -

* Positive Sides `possidey` -

* Positive Sides `possidez` -

Negative Sides `negside` - ⊞ - When Render Mode is Cube Map, specify which sides if the cube map are rendered, -X, -Y, or -Z.

* Negative Sides `negsidex` -

* Negative Sides `negsidey` -

* Negative Sides `negsidez` -

Transparency `transparency` - ⊞ - Refer to to the same parameter in the [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") help page.

* Sorted Draw with Blending `sortedblending` -

* Order Independent Transparency `orderind` -

* Alpha-to-Coverage `alphatocoverage` -

Depth Peel `depthpeel` - Refer to to the same parameter in the [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") help page.
Transparency/Peel Layers `transpeellayers` - Refer to to the same parameter in the [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") help page.

Render `render` - Enables rendering; 1 = on, 0 = off.
Dither `dither` - Dithers the rendering to help deal with banding and other artifacts created by precision limitations of 8-bit displays.
Color Output Needed `coloroutputneeded` - This is an optimization if you don't actually need the color result from this pass. Turning this off avoids a copy from the offscreen render buffer to the TOP's texture. When anti-aliasing is enabled turning this off will also avoid 'resolving' the anti-aliasing.
Draw Depth Only `drawdepthonly` - This will cause the render to only draw depth values to the depth buffer. No color values will be created. To make use of the depth buffer, use the [Depth TOP](Depth_TOP.html "Depth TOP").
Allow Blending for Extra Buffers `allowbufblending` - ⊞ - Controls if blending (as enabled by the MAT common page setting) will be enabled for extra buffers beyond the first one. Often the extra buffers are used to write other types of information such as normals or positions, where blending wouldn't be desirable.

* Use Input Setting `useinput` -

Cull Face `cullface` - ⊞ - Front Faces, Back Faces, Both Faces, Neither. Will cause the render to avoid rendering certain polygon faces depending on their orientation to the camera. Refer to [Back-Face Culling](https://docs.derivative.ca/Back-Face_Culling "Back-Face Culling") for more information.

* Neither `neither` -

* Back Faces `backfaces` -

* Front Faces `frontfaces` -

* Both Faces `bothfaces` -

Override Material `overridemat` - This allows you to specific a material that will be applied to every Geometry that is rendered in the Render TOP. It is useful for pre-processing passes where we are outputting infoformation about the geometry rather then lighting them and outputting RGB.
Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset` - This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly ontop of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](Z-Fighting.html "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](Polygon_Depth_Offset.html "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing shadows.
Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor` - Refer to to the same parameter in the [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") help page.
Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits` - Refer to to the same parameter in the [Render TOPs](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") help page.
Display Overdraw `overdraw` - This feature visually shows the overdraw in the scene. Refer to the [Early Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Early_Depth-Test "Early Depth-Test") article for more information. In particular the Analyzing Overdraw section.
Overdraw Limit `overdrawlimit` - This value quantizes the outputted color value to some # of overdraws. Refer to the [Early Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Early_Depth-Test "Early Depth-Test") for more information.

Crop Left `cropleft` - Positions the left edge of the rendered image.
Crop Left Unit `cropleftunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Pixels, Fraction (0-1), Fraction Aspect (0-1 considering aspect ratio).

Crop Right `cropright` - Positions the right edge of the rendered image.

Crop Bottom `cropbottom` - Positions the bottom edge of the rendered image.
Crop Bottom Unit `cropbottomunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Pixels, Fraction (0-1), Fraction Aspect (0-1 considering aspect ratio).

Crop Top `croptop` - Positions the top edge of the rendered image.
Crop Top Unit `croptopunit` - ⊞ - Select the units for this parameter from Pixels, Fraction (0-1), Fraction Aspect (0-1 considering aspect ratio).

Sampler `sampler` -
Name `sampler0name` - This is the sampler name that the GLSL program will use to sample from this TOP. The samplers need to be declared as the same dimensions as the TOP (sampler2D for a 2D TOP, sampler3D for 3D TOP).
TOP `sampler0top` - ⊞ - This is the TOP that will be referenced by the above sampler name above it.
Extend U `sampler0extendu` - ⊞ -

Vector `vec` -
Uniform Name `vec0name` - The uniform name, as declared in the shader.
Value `vec0value` - ⊞ -

Render Pick CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Render Pick CHOP

The Render Pick CHOP samples a rendering (from a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") or a [Render Pass TOP](Render_Pass_TOP.html "Render Pass TOP")) and returns 3D information from the geometry at that particular pick location. Values sampled can include position, normals, point color, texture coordinates, depth and the object's path. An [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") should be used to retrieve the object's path.

The pick location is specified through uv coordinates of the rendering. These uv coordinates can be selected by clicking on a [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") or explicitly setting them in the U and V parameters in the Render Pick CHOP.

Along with the geometric data returned, this node has two channels 'picked' and 'trigger' that inform the picked status. 'picked' will be 1 when an object has been found at the search location. 'trigger' will be 1 when both an object has been found, and the 'Picking By' condition has been met. That is, either the 'Panel Value' is 1, or the 'Select' parmeter is 'On.

See also the multi-sample [Render Pick DAT](Render_Pick_DAT.html "Render Pick DAT").

## Parameters - Render Pick Page

Strategy `strategy` - ⊞ - Decides when to update values based on pick interactions.

* While Select `select` -

* Hold First Picked `holdfirst` - Holds the values first returned when geometry picked.

* Hold Last Picked `holdlast` - Holds the values last returned when geometry picked. This differs from the Continuous strategy in that it will hold the last values picked on geometry if the pick starts sampling empty space (no geometry in that part of the scene). Alternatively, using the Continuous strategy the values will be cleared to zero if the pick starts sampling empty space.

Clear Previous Pick on New Pick `clearprev` - This parameter is only enabled when the Strategy is set to Hold Last Picked. When this is on, starting a new pick on empty space will clear the values. When off, the last values will be held if the pick starts on empty space.
Response Time `responsetime` - ⊞ - Determines when the values are updated.

* Next Cook (Faster) `nextcook` - The values are captured on the current frame and updated next frame. Results are from the previous frame, but much faster cook times.

* This Cook (Slower) `thiscook` - The values are captured and updated in the current frame.

Pick Radius `pickradius` - Controls the radius of the search area for the pick. If nothing is found at the pick's center it will keep searching for geometry in the search area defined by the Pick Radius.
Pick Radial Step `pickradstep` - Used to reduce the searching within the search area. The search area is sampled at locations that correspond to 'spokes' outwards from the center pick point.
Pick Circular Step `pickcirstep` - Used to reduce the searching within the search area. The search area is sampled at locations that correspond to 'rings' outwards from the center pick point.
Render/RenderPass TOP `rendertop` - Specifies which render to sample.
Use Pickable Flags `usepickableflags` - When turned on only geometry whose [Pickable Flag](Flag.html "Flag") is on can be selected by the Render Pick CHOP. The [Pickable Flag](Pickable_Flag.html "Pickable Flag") is found on all [Object](Object.html "Object") components.
Include Non-Pickable Objects `includenonpickable` - Includes the non-pickable objects in the picking algorithm such that non-pickable objects may occlude pickable objects. For example, if there is only one pickable object in the scene with lots of additional non-pickable geometry is present, turning this parameter on will prevent the pickable object from being selected if it is behind a non-pickage object (occluded by the non-pickage object).
Picking by `pickingby` - ⊞ - Determines how the pick location is set.

* Panel `panel` - Uses the Panel Component scoped in the **Panel** parameter. The uv position of the mouse on this component's control panel will be the uv position in the render that is sampled. The pick is active when the panel value specified by the **Panel Value** parameter is 1.

* Parameters `parameters` - Uses the **U**, **V**, and **Pick** parameters below for picking.

Panel `panel` - Specifies which panel component to use when picking by panel.
Panel Value `panelvalue` - Specifies with panel value to use to trigger the pick when picking by panel.
U `picku` - Sets the u coordinate when picking by parameters.
V `pickv` - Sets the v coordinate when picking by parameters.
Select `select` - When picking by parameters, picking is active when this parameter = 1.
Activate Callbacks `activatecallbacks` - Enables Callback DAT for each pick event.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callbacks for pick event received.

Render Pick DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Render Pick DAT

The Render Pick DAT lets you get information about the 3D surface at any pixel of any 3D render, allowing you to implement multi-touch on a 3D rendered scene. It samples a rendering (from a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") or a [Render Pass TOP](Render_Pass_TOP.html "Render Pass TOP")) and returns 3D information from the geometry at the specified pick locations.

You feed it a DAT with minimum three columns: `select`, `u` and `v`. A [Multi Touch In DAT](Multi_Touch_In_DAT.html "Multi Touch In DAT") is usually connected to the Render Pick DAT, where the Multi Touch In DAT points to a container that is displaying the output of the Render TOP.

You can pick from multiple cameras simultaneously. You can specify a `camera` which allows the pick to occur from the point of a view other than the first camera listed in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). The value in the column can either be a path (relative to the Render Pick DAT, or absolute) to a Camera COMP, or it can be an integer index, started at 0. If it's an index it will select the camera to use if there are multiple cameras listed in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"), or if there are cameras listed in the 'Custom Pick Camera(s)' parameter. This is useful for various [Multi-Camera Rendering](Multi-Camera_Rendering.html "Multi-Camera Rendering") setups, and cases such as VR where your picking isn't coming from the point of view of your eye cameras, but instead hand controllers.

The pick location is a u,v (horizontal, vertical) coordinate placed in the table that you connect to the Render Pick DAT input. Each row of the input table represents one pick point to be sampled, except for the first row which contains column headings `select`, `u` and `v` (plus any other unused columns you want). The `select`, `u` and `v` columns are what you would get from a [Panel CHOP](Panel_CHOP.html "Panel CHOP"). The u and v values goes 0 to 1 left to right and bottom to top, no matter what the aspect ratio of the render is.

When Strategy is Always, that u,v location is always sampled and the results are displayed in the corresponding row in the Render Pick DAT output.

The output table will show the path of the geometry that was picked, its position (in a choice of reference frames), surface normal (excluding bump mapping), distance from camera, texture UV coordinate, color, alpha and instance id. It properly picks surfaces with deforming vertices.

There are some examples here:

* [geoPanel](Palette_geoPanel.html "Palette:geoPanel") in the palette.
* [multiTouch](Palette_multiTouch.html "Palette:multiTouch") in the palette under Techniques.
* [Render Pick DAT Example](http://www.derivative.ca/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=166&p=13447).

* While Select `select` - Continuously updates values when being selected/picked.

* Always `always` - Continuously updates values at the location picked.

Pick Radius `pickradius` - Controls the radius of the search area for the pick. If nothing is found at the pick's center it will keep searching for geometry in the search area defined by the Pick Radius.
Pick Radial Step `pickradstep` - Used to reduce the searching within the search area. The search area is sampled at locations that correspond to 'spokes' outwards from the center pick point.
Pick Circular Step `pickcirstep` - Used to reduce the searching within the search area. The search area is sampled at locations that correspond to 'rings' outwards from the center pick point.
Render/RenderPass TOP `rendertop` - Specifies which scene to pick on, and which camera to pick from. By default the first camera listed in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") will be used for picking. Another camera can be specified with the 'Custom Pick Camera(s)' parameter, and multiple different cameras can be selected using the `camera` input column.
Custom Pick Camera(s) `custompickcameras` - Picking can be done from the viewport of custom camera(s) by specifying one or more [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") here. If this parameter is blank the cameras from the Render TOP are used. To pick from the viewpoint of multiple different cameras, a `camera` column must be specified in the input DAT.
Allow Multi-Camera Rendering `allowmulticamera` - [Multi-Camera Rendering](Multi-Camera_Rendering.html "Multi-Camera Rendering") is a faster way to render multiple passes at the same time, and is thus a speed improvement for doing many picks at the same time. This feature may not work correctly for some older [GLSL MATs](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") made in 088 though, so this parameter allows forcing off this speed improvement if necessary. Generally it should be left on though.
Use Pickable Flags `usepickableflags` - When turned on only geometry whose [Pickable Flag](Flag.html "Flag") is on can be selected by the Render Pick DAT. The Pickable Flag is found on all [Object](Object.html "Object") components.
Include Non-Pickable Objects `includenonpickable` - Includes the non-pickable objects in the picking algorithm such that non-pickable objects may occlude pickable objects. For example, if there is only one pickable object in the scene with lots of additional non-pickable geometry is present, turning this parameter on will prevent the pickable object from being selected if it is behind a non-pickage object (occluded by the non-pickage object).
Merge Input DAT `mergeinputdat` - Appends input table to the Render Pick DATs columns.
Activate Callbacks `activatecallbacks` - Enables Callback DAT for each pick event.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callbacks for pick event received.

Fetch Position `position` - ⊞ - Returns the position of the point picked on the geometry. Columns *tx, ty, tz*.

Fetch Normal `normal` - ⊞ - Returns the normals of the point picked on the geometry. Columns *nx, ny, nz*.

Reference Object `referenceobj` - Object used when fetching position or normals **Relative to Object**.
Fetch Point Color `color` - Returns the point color of the point picked on the geometry. Columns *cr, cg, cb, ca*.
Fetch Texture UV `uv` - Returns the texture coordinates of the point picked on the geometry. Columns *mapu, mapv, mapw*.
Fetch Depth `depth` - Returns the depth of the point picked on the geometry. This value a non-linear ratio of the point's position between the near and far planes of the [Depth Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Depth_Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Depth Buffer (page does not exist)"). Column is *depth*.
Fetch Instance ID `instanceid` - Returns the Instance ID of the object. This will always be 0 if instancing is off. Column is *instance*.
Custom Attrib 1 `customattrib1` - Specify which custom attributes to return from the object.
Custom Attrib 1 Type `customattrib1type` - The type of attribute is selected from this menu.
Custom Attrib 2 `customattrib2` - Specify which custom attributes to return from the object.
Custom Attrib 2 Type `customattrib2type` - The type of attribute is selected from this menu.

Render TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Render TOP

The Render TOP is used to render all 3D scenes in TouchDesigner. You need to give it a [Camera](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") object and a [Geometry](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") object as a minimum.

The Geometry object needs to have a [Material](MAT.html "MAT") assigned to it. Materials can be pre-packaged ones like the [Phong](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT") material, or they can be OpenGL GLSL shaders. All textures and bump maps in TouchDesigner materials are TOPs, i.e. files must be read in via [Movie File In TOPs](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP").

Rendering in TouchDesigner ties in nicely with compositing via the Render TOP and all other TOPs.

The Render TOP renders in many RGBA and single-channel formats, in 8-bit fixed-point up to to 32-bit floating point per pixel component.

It can render transparent surfaces correctly using Multi-Pass Depth Peeling. See below: Order Independent Transparency.

Multiple Cameras: The Render TOP is able to render multiple cameras (more quickly than separately) in a single node. You specify multiple cameras in one Camera parameter, and use Render Select TOP to pull out those camera results. This feature is even faster on GPUs that support [Multi-Camera Rendering](Multi-Camera_Rendering.html "Multi-Camera Rendering").

Multiple Images out: The Render TOP, working with the GLSL MATs, can output multiple image at arbitrary formats, through the Images page.

See also [Rendering](Rendering.html "Rendering"), all the articles in the [Rendering Category](http://www.derivative.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Rendering), the [Render Pass TOP](Render_Pass_TOP.html "Render Pass TOP"), and the troubleshooting page [Why is My Render Black](Why_is_My_Render_Black.html "Why is My Render Black").

NOTE: If you are doing non-realtime GPU-intensive renders (ones that take multiple seconds to render a single SOP), see the note in Windows GPU Driver Timeouts in the [Movie File Out TOP](Movie_File_Out_TOP.html "Movie File Out TOP").

Camera(s) `camera` - Specifies which [Cameras](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") to look through when rendering the scene. You can specify multiple cameras and retrieve each camera image using the Render Select TOP.
Multi-Camera Hint `multicamerahint` - ⊞ - Helps the Render TOP optimize rendering when multiple cameras are used. Controls the [Multi-Camera Rendering](Multi-Camera_Rendering.html "Multi-Camera Rendering") behavior for this node.

* Automatic `automatic` - The node will decide based on the GPU and setup if [Multi-Camera Rendering](Multi-Camera_Rendering.html "Multi-Camera Rendering") can be used and enable it if possible. Currently Multi-Camera rendering works for 2D and Cube Map renders on supported GPUs. For 2D renders multiple cameras can not be rendered in a single pass if their 'Camera Light Mask' parameters don't result in the same lights being used in the scene. Use of Depth Peeling or Order Independent Transparency will also disable Multi-Camera rendering.

* Off (One Pass Per Camera) `off` - Forces Multi-Camera Render to be disabled, so each camera is rendered one pass at a time.

* X-Offset Stereo Cameras `stereocameras` - Should be set only if the pair of cameras have transform/projection matrices that result in a difference only in the X-axis after being applied, as is the case for most VR headsets. Other differences between the cameras such as FOV, near/far plane etc will be ignored, and the values form the first camera will be used. This hint allows the TOP to run faster for this particular case, when appropriate hardware is available.

Geometry `geometry` - Specifies which [Geometry](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") will be included in the rendered scene. You can use [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") to specify objects using patterns. Example: `geo* ^geo7` will render all Geometry components whose names start with `geo` except `geo7`.
Lights `lights` - Specifies which [Lights](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") will be used to render the scene. You can use [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") here as well.
Anti-Alias `antialias` - ⊞ - Sets the level of anti-aliasing in the scene. Setting this to higher values uses more graphics memory.

* 1x (Off) `aa1` -

* 8x (Medium) `aa8mid` -

* 8x (High) `aa8high` -

* 16x (Low) `aa16low` -

* 16x (Medium) `aa16mid` -

* 16x (High) `aa16high` -

Render Mode `rendermode` - ⊞ - You can render different projections: normal 2D, Cube Map, Fish Eye (180), or Dual Paraboloid. The Cube Map renders 6 views as needed for environment maps in the [Phong MAT](Phong_MAT.html "Phong MAT") and [Environment Light COMP](Environment_Light_COMP.html "Environment Light COMP").

See also the [Cube Map TOP](Cube_Map_TOP.html "Cube Map TOP") and the [Projection TOP](Projection_TOP.html "Projection TOP").

* 2D `render2d` - The standard 2D render mode.

* Cube Map `cubemap` - Does 6 renders, each with 90 degree FOV. The camera is automatically turned to face down each of the 6 axis, with the -Z axis being where the camera is facing to start.

* Fish-Eye (180) `fisheye180` - A single 2D render that warps the projection so it renders 180 degree FOV in all directions from where the camera is pointing (90 to each side). Since this render doesn't preserve straight lines, geometry that has large polygons that cover a lot of the viewport will suffer from artifacts. Well tesselated geometry is best for this mode.

* Dual Paraboloid `dualparaboloid` - Similar to Fisheye, but renders twice at 180 degrees, once forward and once backwards. The projection isn't the same as fisheye either. This is a legacy mode that isn't currently consumed by anything in TouchDesigner, but there are articles online that discuss how to sample from it.

* UV Unwrap `uvunwrap` - A 2D render that uses the UV coordinates of the geometry to unwrap it across the output image.

* Cube Map (Omnidirectional Stereo) `cubemapods` - This mode renders a stereo pair (two eyes) of cubemaps that can be used to record out stereo 360 videos. You can obtain the second eye's output by using a [Render Select TOP](Render_Select_TOP.html "Render Select TOP") and selecting Camera Index=1. The [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP")'s IPD Shift parameter is used here to offset each eye viewport.

Positive Sides `posside` - ⊞ - When Render Mode is Cube Map, specify which sides if the cube map are rendered, +X, +Y, or +Z.

UV Unwrap Coord `uvunwrapcoord` - ⊞ - When Render Mode is UV Unwrap Coord, select which Texture Layer the coordinates are rendered to,

UV Unwrap Coord Attribute `uvunwrapcoordattrib` -
Transparency `transparency` - ⊞ - Helps to render transparent geometry in proper depth order. More in-depth discussion available in the [Transparency article](Transparency.html "Transparency").

* Sorted Draw with Blending `sortedblending` - [https://docs.derivative.ca/Transparency#Sorting\_Geometry\_Objects](Transparency.html#Sorting_Geometry_Objects)

* Order Independent Transparency `orderind` - [https://docs.derivative.ca/Transparency#Order-Independent\_Transparency](Transparency.html#Order-Independent_Transparency)

* Alpha-to-Coverage `alphatocoverage` - [https://docs.derivative.ca/Transparency#Alpha-to-Coverage](Transparency.html#Alpha-to-Coverage)

Depth Peel `depthpeel` - Depth peeling is a technique used as part of Order-Independent Transparency, but this parameter allows you to use it in a different way. This parameter enables rendering depth-peels, but without combining all the layers using blending to create order independent transparency. Instead is keeps all the layers separate and they can be retrieved using a [Render Select TOP](Render_Select_TOP.html "Render Select TOP"). Depth peeling is done by first rendering rendering geometry normally and saving that image and depth. Then another render is done but the closest pixels that were occluded by the previous pass are written to the color buffer instead. This can be done multiple times, each time peeling back farther into the scene. If you are rendering a sphere the first render will be the outside of the sphere, and the second peel layer will be the back-inside of the sphere.
Transparency/Peel Layers `transpeellayers` - Number of passes the renderer will use when Order Independant Transparency is turned on.

Render `render` - Enables rendering; 1 = on, 0 = off.
Dither `dither` - Dithers the rendering to help deal with banding and other artifacts created by precision limitations of 8-bit displays.
Color Output Needed `coloroutputneeded` - This is an optimization if you don't actually need the color result from this pass. Turning this off avoids a copy from the offscreen render buffer to the TOP's texture. When anti-aliasing is enabled, turning this off will also avoid 'resolving' the anti-aliasing.
Draw Depth Only `drawdepthonly` - This will cause the render to only draw depth values to the depth buffer. No color values will be created. To make use of the depth buffer, use the [Depth TOP](Depth_TOP.html "Depth TOP").

# of Color Buffers `numcolorbufs` - Any shader you write can output to more than one RGBA buffer at a time. For GLSL 3.3+ you would use the layout(location = 1) specifier on an out variable in the pixel shader to write to the 2nd buffer. In GLSL 1.2 instead of writing to `gl_FragColor` in your shader, you write to `gl_FragData[i]` where i is the color buffer index you want to write the value to.
Allow Blending for Extra Buffers `allowbufblending` - Controls if blending (as enabled by the MAT common page setting) will be enabled for extra buffers beyond the first one. Often the extra buffers are used to write other types of information such as normals or positions, where blending wouldn't be desirable.
Depth Buffer Format `depthformat` - ⊞ - Use either a 24-bit Fixed-Point or 32-bit Floating-Point depth buffer (single channel image).

Override Material `overridemat` - This allows you to specify a material that will be applied to every Geometry that is rendered in the Render TOP. It is useful for pre-processing passes where we are outputting information about the geometry rather then lighting them and outputting RGB.
Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset` - This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly ontop of each other and are experiencing [Z-Fighting](Z-Fighting.html "Z-Fighting"). Refer to [Polygon Depth Offset](Polygon_Depth_Offset.html "Polygon Depth Offset") for more information. This is also an important feature when doing shadows.
Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor` - Adds an offset to the Z value that depends on how sloped the surface is to the viewer.
Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits` - Adds a constant offset to the Z value.
Display Overdraw `overdraw` - This feature visually shows the overdraw in the scene. Refer to the [Early Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Early_Depth-Test "Early Depth-Test") article for more information. In particular the Analyzing Overdraw section.
Overdraw Limit `overdrawlimit` - This value quantizes the outputted color value to some # of overdraws. Refer to the [Early Depth-Test](https://docs.derivative.ca/Early_Depth-Test "Early Depth-Test") for more information.

Cropping here occurs using the projection matrix. It reduces the amount of the output render that is visible, without changing the resolution. It's particuarly useful to create sub-portion of an overall render in different buffers, such as for rendering across multiple instances of TouchDesigner. Be careful to set the aspect ratio of the Render TOP to match the 'real' aspect of the overall output image, not the aspect of this subsection. Otherwise the projection will be stretched incorrectly.

These vectors will be passed to all GLSL MATs used in the render. They allow for global parameters to more easily be passed to many GLSL MATs from a single spot.

Vector `vec` - Sequence of uniform name and value pairs.
Uniform Name `vec0name` - The uniform name, as declared in the shader.
Value `vec0value` - ⊞ - The value to assign the vector uniform.

These samplers will be passed to all GLSL MATs used in the render. They allow for global parameters to more easily be passed to many GLSL MATs from a single spot.

Uniform Name `uni0name` - The uniform name, as declared in the shader.
Sampler `sampler` - Sequence of sampler parmaeters, including uniform name, TOP reference, and sampling parameters.
Sampler Name `sampler0name` - This is the sampler name that the GLSL program will use to sample from this TOP. The samplers need to be declared as the same dimensions as the TOP (sampler2D for a 2D TOP, sampler3D for 3D TOP).
TOP `sampler0top` - ⊞ - This is the TOP that will be referenced by the above sampler name above it.
Extend U `sampler0extendu` - ⊞ -

Images are texture data that can be both read and written to at arbitrary pixels during a render operation, using a [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT"), via the `imageStore()` and `imageLoad()`. You can obtain the results of the Image after the render is completed using a [Render Select TOP](Render_Select_TOP.html "Render Select TOP"). The images will automatically be declared for you inside of the shader, you should not declare them yourself (as you do for other uniforms). This is because there is a lot of extra decoration required for the image uniforms. Currently when compiling in the [GLSL MAT](GLSL_MAT.html "GLSL MAT") itself your code will result in an error, since the images are not available there. However when you apply your MAT to a geometry and render it via the Render TOP, a new version of your shader will be included that has that image declared. Refer to [Write\_a\_GLSL\_Material#Image\_Outputs](Write_a_GLSL_Material.html#Image_Outputs "Write a GLSL Material") for more information.

Image `image` - A sequence of parameters to control image outputs available for the GLSL MATs.
Name `image0name` - The uniform name for the image.
Array Length `image0arraylength` - If this value is 1 or greater, then the uniform is declared as an array and should be accessed using []. If this is 0 then it is not an array.
Resolution `image0res` - ⊞ - The resolution the image should be.

* Resolution `image0resw` -

* Resolution `image0resh` -

Format `image0format` - ⊞ - The pixel format the image should be allocated as.

* Use Output `useoutput` - Use the same pilxe format that the Render TOPs main texture is set to be.

* sRGB 8-bit fixed (RGBA) `srgba8fixed` -

* \_separator\_ `_separator_` -

* 11-bit float (RGB), Positive Values Only `rgba11float` -

* 8-bit fixed (Mono) `mono8fixed` -

* 16-bit fixed (Mono) `mono16fixed` -

* 16-bit float (Mono) `mono16float` -

* 32-bit float (Mono) `mono32float` -

* 16-bit fixed (A) `a16fixed` -

* 8-bit fixed (Mono+Alpha) `monoalpha8fixed` -

* 16-bit fixed (Mono+Alpha) `monoalpha16fixed` -

* 16-bit float (Mono+Alpha) `monoalpha16float` -

* 32-bit float (Mono+Alpha) `monoalpha32float` -

Type `image0type` - ⊞ - Specify what type of texture to create with the image output.

* 2D Texture `texture2d` -

* 2D Texture Array `texture2darray` -

* 3D Texture `texture3d` -

* Cube Texture `texturecube` -

Depth `image0depth` - Set the depth when output Type is 2D Texture Array or 3D Texture.
Access `image0access` - ⊞ - Controls how the output textures will be accessed. If the textures will be read from (such as using values generated by other shader executions within the same frame), then the access should be changed to Read-Write instead of Write Only.

Extra Information for the Render TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

RenderStream In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# RenderStream In CHOP

This node is the primary node to control and configure a connection with the [RenderStream](https://docs.derivative.ca/RenderStream "RenderStream") protocol from [Disguise](https://www.disguise.one/en/products/renderstream/). Along with being the sync-point for when a frame starts rendering, it also brings in all of the control channels, and also takes a DAT with schema information to create controllable parameters within Disguise.

Usually you want to have the 'Real-Time' flag on the top of the TouchDesigner UI turned off when using this node, so that this node is what drives frame advancement, not the default TouchDesigner time advancement.

See the [RenderStream](https://docs.derivative.ca/RenderStream "RenderStream") article for more information.

Reorder CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Reorder CHOP

The Reorder CHOP re-orders the first input CHOP's channels by numeric or alphabetic patterns. Either a channel pattern specifies the new order, or a number sequence specifies the new order.

If the second input, the Order Reference is present, the Numeric Pattern and Character Pattern are ignored, and the first input CHOP's channels are reordered to match as well as possible the reference CHOP's. In this case, Method is not used.

Channel values are never affected.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[reorderCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ReorderCHOP_Class "ReorderCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Reorder Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - There are three different reordering methods. You can enter a Numeric Pattern, a Character Pattern, or use an optional second input CHOP as an order reference.

* Numeric Pattern `numeric` - This reorders the channels by channel number.

* Character Pattern `character` - This reorders the channels by channel name.

* Base Name Sort `basename` - This reorders the channels by their base name discounting the numeric suffix. For example `chan1, abc10` will be reordered to `abc10, chan1`

* Numeric Suffix Sort `numsuffix` - This reorders the channels by their numeric suffix discounting the base name. For example `abc10, chan1` will be reordered to `chan1, abc10`

* Channel Value Up `chanvalueup` - This reorders the channels by the channel's value, lowest first.

* Channel Value Down `chanvaluedown` - This reorders the channels by the channel's value, highest first.

* Reverse `reverse` - This reverses the input CHOP's channel order.

* Random `random` - This reorders the channels randomly.

* Merge N Groups `group` - This reorders the channels in groups the size of N, specified through the `N Value` parameter. This can be useful if you have a sequence of channels `r1, r2, ., rx, g1, g2, ., gx, b1, b2, ., bx` and your desired order is `r1, g1, b1, r2, g2, b2, ., rx, gx, bx`

* Every Nth Channel `split` - This reorders the channels by selecting every Nth channel, specified through the `N Value` parameter.

Order Reference `orderref` - ⊞ - Only enabled if a second input is present. Specifies the format of that input.

* By Name `byname` - The input consists of a list of channels, whose names specify the order.

* By Index `byindex` - The input consists of a single channel, whose sample values specify the order.

Numeric Pattern `numpattern` - This reorders the channels by channel number. Normally the index order is 0,1,2,3... etc.. The first channel is at index 0. Standard numeric patterns are allowed such as `"0-6:1,2"` or `"!*:1,3"`.
Character Pattern `charpattern` - This reorders the channels by channel name. Standard character patterns are allowed such as `"ch[XYZ]"` or `"chan[1-15:2,5]"` or `"chan? ch*"`. See Scope and Channel Name Matching Options p. 102 in the section, Standard Options of CHOPs.
Seed `seed` - Only available if `Channel Reorder Method` is set to "Random", specify any number, integer or non-integer, which starts the random number generator. Each number gives completely different patterns, but with similar characteristics.
N Value `nvalue` - Only available if `Channel Reorder Method` is set to "Merge N Groups" or "Every Nth Channel".
Remaining Position `rempos` - ⊞ - Channels that do not match are called "remaining" and can also be ordered: they can be placed at the At Beginning or At Ending (in reference to the position of the matched channels).

* At Beginning `begin` -

* At Ending `end` -

Remaining Order `remorder` - ⊞ - The channels that did not match can have the Same as Input order, or can be sorted AlphaNumerically.

* Same as Input `input` -

* AlphaNumeric `alpha` -

Replace CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Replace CHOP

The Replace CHOP can be used to replace channels very quickly. The output of channels in Input1 will be replaced by channels found in Input2 if a matching channel exists in Input2. Any channels that are in Input1 and not in Input2 will be output without being replaced.

You can also use this to quickly delete channels (this method can be faster than the [Delete CHOP](Delete_CHOP.html "Delete CHOP")). To do this send all the channels to Input2, then send the channels you want to keep to Input1.

Replicator COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Replicator COMP

The Replicator COMP creates copies of a component, one for every row in a table or using a Number of Replicants parameter - it is the "for-loop" of operators. Unlike [Clone](Clone.html "Clone"), it automatically creates copies of a master component.

It creates replicant nodes ("[replicants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicant)") and deletes them as the table changes or the replicant count changes. The replicant master can be a full component and its contents or a single node.

It takes the node specified in the Master Node parameter, and makes a copy of the master for every row in the Template Table (or specified by the Number of Replicant parameter).

The nodes that are created can be named in two ways. Copies can be named/numbered sequentially using
the prefix specified by the Node Prefix parameter: `item1`, `item2`, ... Alternately, copies can be named based on the string in a column of the table, specified with the Name from Table parameter.

[![Replicator.1.png](images/thumb/d/d4/Replicator.1.png/700px-Replicator.1.png)](File_Replicator.1.html)

If you want to create a node for the first row of the table, un-set the Ignore First Row parameter.

The replicants get laid out in a grid in the network, determined by the Layout and Layout Origin parameters.

The Replicator does not assume or require that the master and replicants are components – they can all be Movie File In TOPs if you want. It also does not assume or require that the replicants are [Clones](Clone.html "Clone"). However the Master Node can be a component whose [Clone](Clone.html "Clone") parameter is set to itself, so that all nodes created are clones of the master.

For every replicant, you can run a script in the callback DAT where you can see some examples of typical cases that you can adapt. Here are some others:

* change the expression of a [parameter](Par_Class.html "Par Class"): `c.par.display.expr = "op('thing')[op.digits, 'display']"`
* Change the parameter expression mode: `c.par.display.mode = ParMode.EXPRESSION` The mode is one of: `ParMode.CONSTANT`, `ParMode.EXPRESSION`, or `ParMode.EXPORT`.

If only one line of a table changes, the other existing replicants are not changed or re-created. In the callback DAT, removing `onRemoveReplicant()` will keep the replicants around to be re-used when the table grows again.

This is an extremely powerful node type. Examples: (1) A button gadget for each row of the table. a geometry component, which is replicated at every point of a 3D particle system, each behaving separately. (2) You can feed the table of a [Multi Touch In DAT](Multi_Touch_In_DAT.html "Multi Touch In DAT") directly to the Replicator to create something at each fingertip.

  + [5.1 Common COMP Info Channels](#Common_COMP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Replicator Page

Replication Method `method` - ⊞ - Choose between using a Template DAT Table where each row will create a replicant or using the Number of Replicants parameter below to set how many replications to make.

* By Number `bynum` -

* By Table `bytable` -

Number of Replicants `numreplicants` - Set number of replicants when using Replication Method = By Number above.
Template DAT Table `template` - Path to the table DAT that will drive the replicating.
Name from Table `namefromtable` - ⊞ - How the node names will be generated.

* Row Index `rowindex` - Uses the Node Prefix parameter followed by the row number. The default creates nodes named `item1`, `item2`, `item3` .... (The top row is 0).

* Column by Index `colbyindex` - The node name is in the column specified by a column number.

* Column by Name `colbyname` - The node name is in a column specified by a column name in the first row.

Ignore First Row `ignorefirstrow` - Do not create a node for the first row.
Column Name `colname` - Name at the top of the column.
Column Index `colindex` - Column number, starting from 0.
Operator Prefix `opprefix` - Add this prefix to all nodes.
Master Operator `master` - Which node or component to replicate.
Destination `destination` - Where to put the replicant nodes. If the location is `..`, it puts the nodes inside the parent, which is actually alongside the Replicator component. If you put `.`, it will put it inside itself, that is, inside the Replicator component. If left blank, it will error.
Maximum Operators `domaxops` - Enable the parameter below to set a maximum number of allowed replicants.
Maximum Operators `maxops` - Max number of nodes replicated.
Script `tscript` - Tscript only (use callback DAT in python): For every replicant, you can run a script to customize it relative to the master, such as setting the Display or Clone parameters, or a Render flag. Replicator runs the script command to customize each replicant versus the master. `me.curItem` can be used here to access the current item and make changes to it. Select one of the 3 entries in the drop menu to the right for some examples.

If you are using [Tscript](Tscript.html "Tscript"), some local variables are defined:

* $ITEM Name of current node being replicated.
* $MASTER Name of master node.
* $LOCATION Name of the location component.

The most common need is for the master to not display, and the replicants to display. For Panel components it is most commonly "`opparm $ITEM paneldisplay ( 1 )`", and for Geometry components it is most commonly "`opset -d on $ITEM`". Use the popup menu for some common scripts.

Script Names `scriptmenu` - Select from some commonly used scripts (Tscript) in this menu.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - Path to a DAT containing callbacks for each event received. See [replicatorCOMP\_Class](ReplicatorCOMP_Class.html "ReplicatorCOMP Class") for usage.
Layout `layout` - ⊞ - How to lay out the new nodes - all in one place (Off), horizontally, vertically, or in a grid.

* Grid `grid` -

Layout Origin `layoutorigin` - ⊞ - Where to lay out the new nodes, giving the XY location of the top-left node's bottom-left corner.

* `layoutorigin1` -

* `layoutorigin2` -

Incremental Update `doincremental` - Enables the parameter below for incremental creation of replicants.
Incremental Update `increment` - Staggers the replication of operators to avoid large frame drops when creating replicants. It will create the specified number of replicants per frame at most, by default 1 per frame, if Incremental Update is on.
Recreate All Operators `recreateall` - Deletes all nodes it has created, then re-creates them using the template and its current parameters.
Recreate Missing Operators `recreatemissing` - Re-creates missing operators from the template table but does not delete and re-create already existing replicants.

Extra Information for the Replicator COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](Component.html "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the Replicator COMP.

# Resample CHOP

The Resample CHOP resamples an input's channels to a new sample rate and/or start/end interval. In all cases, the entire input interval is resampled to match the output interval.

Resample does a simple linear interpolation of the Time Slice in [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") mode. Only the sample rate can be changed.

* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common CHOP Info Channels](#Common_CHOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Parameters - Resample Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - The resample method to apply to the channels:

* Same Rate, New Interval `strech` - Stretches or compresses the channels like the [Stretch CHOP](Stretch_CHOP.html "Stretch CHOP").

* New Rate, Same Time Range `preserve` - Changes the sample rate without changing the time-length of the CHOP.

* New Rate, Same Index Range `index` - Changes the sample rate without changing the number of samples in the CHOP.

* New Rate, New Interval `newint` - Changes both the sample rate and stretches/compresses the CHOP.

Sample Rate `rate` - The new sample rate.
Unit Values `relative` - ⊞ - Determines how the Start/End parameters are interpreted.

* Absolute `abs` - The value is the new start/end position.

* Relative to Start/End `rel` - The value is a shift from the old start/end position.

Start `start` - The CHOP's new start position.
Start Unit `startunit` -
End `end` - The CHOP's new end position.
End Unit `endunit` -
Quaternion Blend `quatrot` - Uses quaternions to blend between samples.
Interpolation `interp` - ⊞ - The interpolation method to use when resampling:

* No Interpolation `nointerp` - Use the value of the nearest sample.

* Linear `linear` - Use linear interpolation between samples when the output has more samples. Averages all samples near the new sample when the output has fewer samples.

* Pulse Preserve `edge` - A linear interpolation that recognizes single sample pulses and preserves their height and one-sample width. A pulse is a non-zero value proceeded and followed by zero-value samples.

Constant Area `constarea` - If enabled, keeps the area under the channel constant by scaling the values of the channel.
Correct for Cycles `correct` - If enabled, compensates for cyclic channels (such as angles) by always choosing the shortest step between samples, like 360 to 0 for angles.
Cycle Length `cyclelen` - The length of the cycle. 360 is typical for angles.

Resample SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Resample SOP

The Resample SOP will resample one or more primitives into even length segments. It only applies to polygons so when presented with a NURBS or Bzier curve input, it first converts it to polygons using the Level of Detail parameter.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[resampleSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ResampleSOP_Class "ResampleSOP Class")

Group `group` - Allows you to specify which primitives or group of primitives to resample. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Level of Detail `lod` - If the geometry you are performing this operation on is made up of something other than polygons (e.g. a NURBS circle), this parameter determines how detailed the conversion to polygons will be. The higher the level of detail, the more precise the resampling process.
Resample by Polygon Edge `edge` - This toggle allows the resampling to be done on a per-edge basis of the polygon rather than on the polygon as a whole. This means that corners will be preserved in the resampling. When this parameter is enabled, the Measure Method will be disabled. If the Segment Length is specified, only edges which are longer than the specified length will be subdivided. Each edge will be evenly subdivided so that the maximum length of each subdivision is less than or equal to the length specified.

If the Maximum Segments is chosen, the edges will not be split into more segments than are specified. If the length parameter is turned off, then each edge will be split into the specified number of segments.

Method `method` - ⊞ - Specifies how the geometry is segmented.

* Even Length Segments `dist` - Even-length measures are made along the original input

[![TouchGeometry199.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/6/65/TouchGeometry199.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry199.gif)

* Even X Segments `x` - \* Even X spaced Segments

[![TouchGeometry209.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/f/ff/TouchGeometry209.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry209.gif)

* Even Y Segments `y` - Similar to X, but along Y axis.

* Even Z Segments `z` - Similar to X, but along Z axis.

Measure `measure` - ⊞ - Specifies how to measure along curved spline sections.

* Along Arc `arc` - This method of measurement divides the curve itself into even length segments.

* Along Chord `chord` - This method creates straight even-length segments between the evaluated points on the primitive. This is faster but not as accurate.

[![TouchGeometry202.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/a/a5/TouchGeometry202.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry202.gif)

Maximum Segment Length `dolength` - When this option is enabled, it overrides the value of the Arc/Chord length and allows you to specify your own values for the length of the segments in the resampled geometry. Smaller values produce smoother interpolation.
Length `length` - This parameter lets you specify the Arc/Chord length for the resampled geometry.
Maximum Segments `dosegs` - When enabled, allows you to override the maximum number of segments used in the resampled geometry.
Segments `segs` - Lets you specify the number of segments used when measuring along arc.

When both Maximum Segment Length and Maximum Segments are selected, the resultant polygon is constrained to a fixed length which may be shorter than the original input curve.

When only Maximum Segments is selected, the segments span the full distance of the original input curve.

When neither option is selected, the input curve is merely converted to a polygon.

Maintain Last Vertex `last` - If selected, the primitive's final CV is included in the resampled polygon, even if the final resulting edge is shorter then the given segment length.

To create a constant length flag with the Resample SOP:

1. Create a number of horizontal lines using a [Grid SOP](Grid_SOP.html "Grid SOP"): Primitive Type: Polygon; Connectivity: Rows; Size: 3, 1
2. Append a [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP"): Group: group1; Entity: Points; Number: Enable; Pattern: 0-99:1,10
3. Append a [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html "Spring SOP"): Source Group: group1; Forces/Wind: 1, 0, 0; Turbulence: 1, 0, -1
4. Clip each line to a constant length by appending a Resample SOP: Maximum Segments On; Segments: 15
5. Appending a [Skin SOP](Skin_SOP.html "Skin SOP") whose parameters can stay at the default, and enable the Points display in the Viewport options.
6. Click Play to view the result. Adjust the view as necessary.
7. Toggle the display SOP back and forth between the Spring SOP and the Skin SOP. Notice how the lines are stretched and deformed from their original length by the forces acting on them in the Spring SOP. After resampling, they are a constant length.

Extra Information for the Resample SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

[Template:ParToggle](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:ParToggle&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:ParToggle (page does not exist)")

* Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses  [mipmap](https://docs.derivative.ca/Mipmapping "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
Pixel Format `format` - ⊞ - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](https://docs.derivative.ca/Pixel_Formats "Pixel Formats") for more information.

Revolve SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Revolve SOP

The Revolve SOP revolves faces to create a surface of revolution. The revolution's direction and origin are represented by guide geometry that resembles a thick line with a cross hair at the centre. The cross hair represents the origin of the revolve as entered in the dialog and the stick represents the direction. Changing any of these parameters will cause the guide to change appropriately.

Run Class - Derivative

# Run Class

The Run class describes a single instance of a delayed script execution. See [Run Command Examples](Run_Command_Examples.html "Run Command Examples") for more info.
They can be accessed from the [runs](Runs_Class.html "Runs Class") object. Scripts can be executed with delays with the following methods:

```
DAT.run()
Cell.run()
td.run()

`active` → `bool` :

> Get or set whether or not this script will execute once its target frame is reached.

`group` → `str` :

> Get or set the group label associated with this script.

`isCell` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> Returns true when the source is a [cell](Cell_Class.html "Cell Class"), from a Cell.run() call.

> Returns true when the source is a [DAT](DAT_Class.html "DAT Class"), from a DAT.run() call.

> Returns true when the source is a string, from a td module run() call

`path` → `OP` **(Read Only)**:

> The [operator](OP_Class.html "OP Class") location from which this script will execute.

`remainingFrames` → `int` :

> Get or set the remaining number of frames before the execution will occur.

`remainingMilliseconds` → `int` :

> Get or set the remaining number of milliseconds before the execution will occur.

`source` → `DAT | Cell | str` **(Read Only)**:

> The source of the run. It will be either a [DAT](DAT_Class.html "DAT Class"), [cell](Cell_Class.html "Cell Class"), or string.

`kill()`→ `None`:

> Kill this run before it executes, and remove it from the global runs list, located in the [td Module](Td_Module.html "Td Module").

Scan CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Scan CHOP

The Scan CHOP converts a [SOP](SOP.html "SOP") or [TOP](TOP.html "TOP") to oscilloscope or laser friendly control waves. The output is usually in the audible range and can be heard directly via an [Audio Device Out CHOP](Audio_Device_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Device Out CHOP"), or used to drive the X and Y deflector inputs of an oscilloscope, or a laser projector recreating the imagery.
The output can also be visualized through use of a [Limit SOP](Limit_SOP.html "Limit SOP").

A sample component found at: [Op to Audio CHOP example](http://www.derivative.ca/Forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=1201)

In the case of TOP input, the number of black/off positions to insert between full raster scans. Color output must be enabled.

## Parameters - TOP Page

A raster image is converted to control signals by converting each pixel's location to X and Y amplitude values. The luminance is controlled by how long each sample is "drawn" on the scope. Since the output is low bandwidth, different resampling and ordering options are available for minimizing (or enhancing) flicker.

TOP `top` - Path to the TOP node.
Width `width` - The number of columns to resample the image at.
Height `height` - The number of rows to resample the image at.
Level `level` - The number of brightness levels each pixel can have.
Auto Reduce `limit` - Automatically reduce the number of rows and columns dynamically to keep the output frame rate

at a constant level.

Layered `layered` - Output the pixels in order of brightness, else they are output left to right for each row.
Interleave `interleave` - ⊞ - Controls the order in which rows are output to minimize flicker.

* Sweep `sweep` - The rows are output in order, from top to bottom.

* Even Odd `evenodd` - The rows are output in two passes, first even, then odd.

* Max `max` - The rows are output in fully interleaved fashion.

## Parameters - SOP Page

Every point in a SOP creates a frame-buffered, stereo audio sample, where the SOP vertex X is placed on the X channel and Y is placed on the Y channel. The oscilloscope output thus contains no aliased lines, just razor-sharp vectors.

SOP `sop` - Path to the SOP node.
Vertex Order `vertexorder` - Output the points in the same order as the vertices of each polygon, instead of the order in which the points are defined in the geometry.
Limit Step Size `limitstep` - Breakup long x,y jumps into several smaller incremental jumps.
Step Size `stepsize` - The distance each x,y can change when above option enabled.
Vertex Repeat `vertexrepeat` - Repeat each vertex of the each primitive multiple times.
Camera `camera` - Project the geometry onto a 2D plane from this camera, otherwise, only the original x,y components of the geometry are used.

## Parameters - CHOP Page

A waveform is converted to control signals by converting each graph into corresponding horizontal and vertical offsets, reproducing the original CHOP waveform. The CHOP should not be [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)"), but instead have some length (example a [Trail CHOP](Trail_CHOP.html "Trail CHOP") or animated [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP")).

CHOP `chop` - Path to the CHOP node.
Trigger `trigger` - The output graph will begin where its value exceeds this value. This allows for steady 'frozen' waveforms, analagous to an oscilloscope triggered sweep.
Trigger Value `triggerval` - The value to begin the trigger.
Trim `trim` - Limit the length of the CHOP to be scanned.
Trim Value `trimval` - The length of the CHOP to be scanned.
Trim Units `trimunits` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.

Script CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Script CHOP

The Script CHOP runs a script each time the Script CHOP cooks. By default, the Script CHOP is created with a docked DAT that contains three Python methods: `cook`, `onPulse`, and `setupParameters`. The `cook` method is run each time the Script CHOP cooks. The `setupParameters` method is run whenever the Setup Parameter button on the Script page is pressed. The `onPulse` method is run whenever a custom pulse parameter is pushed.

Refer to Help -> Python Examples, and Help -> [Operator Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets").

Note: Because the Script CHOP can get data from anywhere, it's difficult to determine what it procedurally depends on. So every time that any Script OP runs it will make a list of operators, parameters, nodes etc that it depends upon, and when they change, the Script OP will re-cook.

The Script CHOP enables numPy arrays to be converted into the CHOP's channels. Also any CHOP can get its channels converted into numPy arrays. (May 2021) See `numPyArray()` in [CHOP Class](CHOP_Class.html "CHOP Class").

Script DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Script DAT

The Script DAT runs a script each time the DAT cooks and can build/modify the output table based in the optional input tables. The Script DAT is created with a [docked](Docking.html "Docking") (attached) DAT that contains three Python methods: `cook`, `onPulse`, and `setupParameters`. The `cook` method is run each time the Script DAT cooks. The `setupParameters` method is run whenever the Setup Parameter button on the Script page is pressed. The `onPulse` method is run whenever a custom pulse parameter is pushed.

Note: Because the Script DAT can get data from anywhere, it's difficult to determine what it procedurally depends on. So every time that any Script OP runs it will add to a list of operators, parameters, nodes etc that it depends upon, and when they change, the Script OP will re-cook. The list is reset when a `.toe` restarts.

# Script SOP

The Script SOP runs a python script each time the Script SOP cooks. It can create, delete and modify points, primitives and their vertices. It can create custom attributes or built-in attributes like `Cd` (color), `uv` and `N` (normals). It can add polygons, bezier curves and meshes among others. It can combine multiple inputs. By default, the Script SOP is created with a docked DAT that contains three Python methods: `cook()`, `onPulse()`, and `setupParameters()`. The `cook()` method is run each time the Script SOP cooks. The `setupParameters()` method is run whenever the Setup Parameter button on the Script page is pressed. The `onPulse()` method is run whenever a custom pulse parameter is pushed.

Script TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Script TOP

The Script TOP can be used to generate a TOP image using a Python script. The core feature it exposes is `copyNumpyArray`, which takes a NumPy array as input, and fills the TOP with the given image. How the NumPy array is generated is entirely up to the script writter, custom code, OpenCV, etc.

The source can be 3 or 4 channels for `copyNumpyArray()`.

The [Script CHOP](Script_CHOP.html "Script CHOP") enables numPy arrays to be converted into the CHOP's channels. Also any CHOP can get its channels converted into numPy arrays. (May 2021)

Select CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Select CHOP

The Select CHOP selects and renames channels from other CHOPs of any CHOP network. You can select the channels from control panel gadgets like sliders and buttons. It retrieves channels from one or more CHOPs.

It selects only the channels you specify. Example: "`c2 c5 c3 c3`" will result in 4 channels, the last two identical, all in the specified order.

There are two ways of getting channels - through the CHOP and Channel Name parameters or directly from a CHOP connected to its input. All extract and renaming options apply when using the CHOP and Channel Name parameters instead of the wired input.

See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") for selecting CHOPs and channels.

It can also rename channels by generating new channel names. See [Pattern Replacement](Pattern_Replacement.html "Pattern Replacement") and [Pattern Expansion](Pattern_Expansion.html "Pattern Expansion") for patterns you can use.

See [Channel Naming Patterns](Rename_CHOP.html#Channel_Naming_Patterns "Rename CHOP") for more ways to manipulate existing channel names into new ones.

(The Select CHOP gets channels from any CHOP, the [Parameter CHOP](Parameter_CHOP.html "Parameter CHOP") gets parameters of any OP.)

See also the [Rename CHOP](Rename_CHOP.html "Rename CHOP") (Select CHOP does most of the same things and more.)

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[selectCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SelectCHOP_Class "SelectCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Select Page

CHOP `chop` - The source(s) of the channels. (Assuming the CHOP is not directly connected).
Channel Names `channames` - The names of the channels to keep. Name patterns may be used. Ex:
```
 chan[1-5] *x /project1/geo1:t[xyz]

The order of the names determine the order of the output channels. If a channel is specified multiple times, it is included in the output multiple times.

Rename from `renamefrom` - The channel pattern to rename. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Rename to `renameto` - The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See [Pattern Replacement](Pattern_Replacement.html "Pattern Replacement").

**Example:**

Channel Names: `c[1-10:2] ambient`
Rename From: `c* ambient`
Rename To: `b[1-5] amb`

This example fetches channels `c1 c3 c5 c7 c9` and `ambient`.

They are then renamed to to `b1 b2 b3 b4 b5` and `amb`.

See the [Rename CHOP](Rename_CHOP.html "Rename CHOP") for a further description of rename patterns.

Filter by Digits `filterbydigits` - This toggle enables the two parameters below to select channels with the specified digits at the end of their name. For examples, this can be used to selct all channels with a name ending in the digit "1", such as tx1, ty1, tz1, rotate1, etc.
Digits `digits` - Specify the digit at then end of the channel names you want to select when using 'Filter by Digits'
Strip Digits `stripdigits` - Then On, the selected channel names are output without the digits. When Off, the selected channel names are not changed.
Align `align` - ⊞ - This menu handles cases where multiple input CHOPs have different start or end times. All channels output from a CHOP share the same start/end interval, so the inputs must be treated with the Align Options:

* Automatic `auto` - It will trim to the current [Time Slice] if there are any Time Slices, else it will do an Extend Min/Max.

Automatic Prefix `autoprefix` - When 2 channels have the same name, turning on this option will add the node's name (or the node's parent's name, etc.) as a prefix to the channel name. For example, if selecting a channel from `/wave1/chan1` and `/wave2/chan1`, the channels would be renamed `chan1` and `chan2` if this option is off. Once turned on the channels would be named `wave1:chan1` and `wave2:chan1`.

# Select COMP

The Select component selects a [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") from any other location. This allows a panel to appear in multiple other panels. Note that the Select component does not support child panels ie. through its output connector or embedded panels.

Can be used to select components recursively. If *select1* points to *select2*, it will display whatever *select2* points to (recursively) using *select2'*s parameters.

The Select component can re-size the component it refers to by setting its Width and Height parameters.

Serial CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Serial CHOP

The Serial CHOP is used for serial communication through an external port, using the RS-232 protocol. These ports are usually a 9 pin connector, or a USB port on new machines. (Using a USB port requires a USB-to-serial adaptor and driver.) All of a computer's available serial ports can be found in the Device Manager under the Windows operating system. Their names begin with 'COM'. Example: COM1, COM2, COM3, etc.

This CHOP monitors changes in its input channels, and sends the corresponding script through the serial connection.
Any ASCII numeric digits '0'..'9' that are received, are stored and reflected in the output channel named 'return'.

When you need to receive more complex data, other than simple ASCII numbers use the [Serial DAT](Serial_DAT.html "Serial DAT").

Data Bits `databits` - ⊞ - This parameter sets the number of data bits sent in each. Data bits are transmitted "backwards". Backwards refers to the order of transmission, which is from least significant bit (LSB) to most significant bit (MSB). To interpret the data bits, you must read from right to left.

* 6 `6` -

* 7 `7` -

* 8 `8` -

* 9 `9` -

Parity `parity` - ⊞ - This parameter can be set to none, even, or odd. The optional parity bit follows the data bits and is included as a simple means of error checking. Parity bits work by specifying ahead of time whether the parity of the transmission is to be even or odd. If the parity is set to be odd, the transmitter will then set the parity bit in such a way as to make an odd number of 1's among the data bits and the parity bit.

* Even `even` -

Stop Bits `stopbits` - ⊞ - The last part of transmission packet consists of 1 or 2 Stop bits. The connection will now wait for the next Start bit.

* 1 `1` -

* 2 `2` -

Script `script` - Sequence of scripts corresponding to input channels. These strings are sent out the serial port when the corresponding channel change is detected. For example, Script 2 is sent to the serial port when the third input channel goes from off to on. These scripts will also convert escape sequences like <CR> and \n for carriage returns and \r for line feed.
Callback `script0callback` - Enter the script for Script 0 here.

# Shift CHOP

The Shift CHOP time-shifts a CHOP, changing the start and end of the CHOP's interval. However, the contents of the channels remain the same.

Each channel can be shifted a different amount by using the $C variable in the Scroll parameter or the Start/End parameters.

An optional second input, the Start/End Reference, is used to align the first input CHOP relative to another reference CHOP. This outputs the channels of the first CHOP only, and the shifts are based on the interval of the second CHOP. It is useful for making several CHOPs match up to the same time.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[shiftCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/ShiftCHOP_Class "ShiftCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Shift Page

Reference `reference` - ⊞ - The start or the end of the channels can be used as the reference position. The channels are shifted by altering the reference position.

* Start Position `refstart` - Uses the start of the CHOP to do the aligning.

* End Position `refend` - Uses the end of the CHOP to do the aligning.

Unit Values `relative` - ⊞ - Determines how the Start and End parameters are to be interpreted:

* Absolute `abs` - The Start/End parameters are the actual start/end position. It is used, for example, to shift the CHOP to start at 0 seconds.

* Relative to Start/End `rel` - The Start/End parameters are a shift relative to the input CHOP's start/end position.

* Relative to Current Frame `cur` - Ignore the Start/End parameters and use the current frame as the new start position.

Start `start` - The start of the interval, absolute or relative to the input CHOP.
Start Unit `startunit` -
End `end` - The end of the interval, absolute or relative to the input CHOP.
End Unit `endunit` -
Scroll Offset `scroll` - Without changing the length of the CHOP, you can scroll the channels within its range, and scroll each channel a different amount. By using $C in the parameter, you can make the scroll amount dependent on the channel index.
Scroll Offset Unit `scrollunit` -

SICK TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# SICK TOP

**OS:** This operator is only supported under the **Windows** operating system.

The SICK TOP can be used to retrieve point cloud data from a LIDAR sensor made by [SICK](SICK.html "SICK"). Sensor results are packed into a floating point texture where each pixel represents one point of data and each color channel stores one field such as x, y or z position. The TOP utilizes the ['sick\_scan\_xd' SDK](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/tree/master) and [supported sensors](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) are listed on the project's GitHub page.

The point cloud texture can be further manipulated using other TOPs such as the [Point Transform TOP](Point_Transform_TOP.html "Point Transform TOP") or [Math TOP](Math_TOP.html "Math TOP") and then used to generate geometry instances using a [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP"), and optionally rendered using a [Line MAT](Line_MAT.html "Line MAT").

Communication with the LIDAR sensor is done over an Ethernet connection and the Device Address parameter can be used to enter the sensor's IP address on your network. The SOPAS Engineering Tool software available from SICK can be used to auto-detect the IP address of connected sensors.

Sensor configuration is handled using an external launch file that can be [downloaded from SICK](https://github.com/SICKAG/sick_scan_xd/tree/master/launch). This file is required for any connection and must match the SDK version and model of your sensor. TouchDesigner currently uses version 3.0.x of the SDK. The version can also be viewed in the TOP's info box by middle-clicking on the node.

**Important:** The 'sick\_scan\_xd' SDK only supports **one** sensor per CPU process, so you may only have one active SICK TOP in a TouchDesigner project file. If multiple SICK TOPs are used, only the first node to cook will activate. To **access multiple sensors** in the same project, use the  [sickEngine](Palette_sickEngine.html "Palette:sickEngine") component in the Point Cloud folder of the palette. It utilizes the [Engine COMP](Engine_COMP.html "Engine COMP") to launch each SICK TOP in a separate process.

**Tip:** To obtain additional debugging and status information you can use the `'TOUCH_TEXT_CONSOLE=1'` environment variable to see output from the SICK SDK in the console window. Note: this only works for SICK TOPs in the primary TouchDesigner project, there is no output for TOPs inside [Engine COMPs](Engine_COMP.html "Engine COMP").

  + [4.1 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Active `active` - Activate the connection to the sensor. Only one SICK node can be active in a project at time. If a second node is activated it will cause an error message.
Reinitialize `reinitialize` - Restart the connection with the sensor. This will shutdown the connection and reinitialize using the current parameters. You can also toggle the Active parameter off and on again to reinitialize the sensor.
Launch File `launchfile` - A path to the launch file to configure the sensor. A valid launch file is necessary to connect to the sensor. Sample launch files for each sensor can be downloaded from SICK's website. Advanced configuration options can be set in the launch file.
Device Address `deviceaddress` - The IP address for the sensor. If this parameter is blank, the default address in the launch file will be used.
Port `port` - The port number for the sensor. If this parameter is blank, the default port number in the launch file will be used.
Custom Arguments `customargs` - Additional arguments that should be included when initializing the sensor. This can be used to customize parameters for individual sensors while still using the same launch file. Arguments should be in the format "name1:=value1 name2:=value2".
Red `red` - The name of the data field that will be assigned to the red component of the output image e.g. 'x'. The available fields will vary depending on the sensor and can be selected from the flyout menu to the right of the parameter.
Green `green` - The name of the data field that will be assigned to the green component of the output image e.g. 'g'. The available fields will vary depending on the sensor and can be selected from the flyout menu to the right of the parameter. 'one' or 'zero' can be used to assign a constant value.
Blue `blue` - The name of the data field that will be assigned to the blue component of the output image e.g. 'z'. The available fields will vary depending on the sensor and can be selected from the flyout menu to the right of the parameter. 'one' or 'zero' can be used to assign a constant value.
Alpha `alpha` - The name of the data field that will be assigned to the alpha component of the output image e.g. 'one'. The available fields will vary depending on the sensor and can be selected from the flyout menu to the right of the parameter. 'one' or 'zero' can be used to assign a constant value.

# Skin SOP

The Skin SOP takes any number of faces and builds a skin surface over them. If given two or more surfaces, however, the SOP builds four skins, one for each set of boundary curves.

All face and surface types are valid as long as the input(s) contain only faces or only surfaces. Different face types can be skinned together into one surface. For example, it is possible to skin a cubic open NURBS curve with a polygon and a quintic closed Bzier curve even if the three faces have a different number of control vertices. Similarly, this SOP can skin the boundary curves of surfaces of different types, number of rows, columns, etc.

When face types are input, the number of input SOPs and the number of faces in each input establish the skinning method. If only one input exists, a "linear-skinning" operation is performed by running a skin across the cross-sections. The result is the classic ruled or skinned surface. If a second input exists, a "bi-linear skinning" is performed which computes a cross-skin between the faces in the first input (U cross-sections) and the faces in the second input (V cross-sections). The result is a surface whose name derives from the number of cross-sections in each direction: triangular, square, or multiple boundary surface, as well as a special case of swept surfaces and N-rails. When possible, cross-sections are interpolated as isoparms.

If you need more control over tangency in the skin, try using the [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP").

**Tip:** If you have problems with the results being skinned in the wrong order, try inserting a Sort SOP ahead of the Skin SOP, and Sort by Normals.

## Types of Surfaces

Single Boundary Surface - One face, open or closed, is converted into a surface whose boundaries match the shape of the face exactly. Basically, this operation builds an interior area for the face. The surface type will be similar to the type of the face. For example, a NURBS curve yields a NURBS surface. If the curve is highly concave, the result may look less satisfactory than expected.

[![TouchGeometry81.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/b/bd/TouchGeometry81.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry81.gif)

Patch - Two boundary faces define a ruled surface. The arrows on the two faces indicate the required parametric direction, which must be the same for both faces to avoid a bad twist in the surface. Use the Primitive SOP or the modeler to correct the problem. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type between the two cross-sections. For example, if a polygon and a NURBS curve are skinned together, the surface type will be NURBS. The surface always contains the two faces as two of its boundaries.

[![TouchGeometry178.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/3/3f/TouchGeometry178.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry178.gif)

Linear Ruled/Skinned Surface - Two or more faces are skinned linearly into a single surface. The arrows on the faces indicate the required parametric direction of each face, which must be the same for all faces to avoid bad twists or flips in the surface. Use the Primitive SOP or the modeler to correct the problem. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type among all cross-sections. For example, if a polygon, a Bzier and a NURBS curve are skinned together, the surface type will be NURBS. The surface goes through each cross-section unless "Preserve Shape" if OFF (see parameters below). If the cross-sections have repeated points, or share points between them, the result might not look good when shape preservation is enabled.

[![TouchGeometry182.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/1/18/TouchGeometry182.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry182.gif)

A Special Swept Surface - This case does a bilinear skin and requires two inputs. The U face (1st input) is swept along the V face (second input). The two faces do not need to touch at their endpoints. If their endpoints coincide, though, the two of the surface's boundaries will match the two faces exactly. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type of the two faces. For example, if a polygon and a Bzier curve are skinned together, the surface type will be Bzier.

[![TouchGeometry186.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/1/19/TouchGeometry186.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry186.gif)

Triangular Surface - This case requires two inputs for the bilinear skin. One input has two faces; the other input, just one. The endpoints of the faces need not coincide, but if they do, the surface boundaries will match the face shapes exactly. Basically, the three faces define an interior area to be filled by a surface. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type among the three boundary faces. For example, if the faces are Bzier and NURBS curves, the surface will be a NURBS primitive.

[![TouchGeometry190.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/7/7e/TouchGeometry190.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry190.gif)

Square Surface - Four faces define the outer boundaries of a surface. This case requires two inputs for the bilinear skin: the two U boundaries (1st input) are cross-skinned with the V boundaries (the 2nd input). The endpoints of the faces need not coincide, but if they do, the surface boundaries will match the face shapes exactly. Basically, the four faces define an interior area to be filled by a surface. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type among the four boundary faces. For example, if the faces are polygons and NURBS curves, the surface will be a NURBS primitive.

[![TouchGeometry194.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/7/70/TouchGeometry194.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry194.gif)

A Special Case of M-rails - One input contains the rails, and the other input the cross-section. The cross-section is swept along the rails to form a surface. The arrows on the faces indicate the required parametric direction of each face, which must be the same for all faces to avoid bad twists or flips in the surface. Use the Primitive SOP or the modeler to correct the problem. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type among both rails and cross-section. For example, if the faces are polygons and NURBS curves, the surface will be a NURBS primitive.

[![TouchGeometry198.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/f/f7/TouchGeometry198.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry198.gif)

Multiple-Boundary Surface - Not to be confused with N-ary patches. This case generalizes the square surface concept by allowing more interior cross-sections both in U and V. If no interior cross-sections exist, this case reduces to a square surface. The surface interpolates all the boundaries and the interior cross-sections. The result improves when the faces intersect. The arrows on the faces indicate the required parametric direction of each face, which must be the same for all faces to avoid bad twists or flips in the surface. Use the Primitive SOP or the modeler to correct the problem. The surface type will be similar to the most complex type among all faces. For example, if the faces are polygons and NURBS curves, the surface will be a NURBS primitive.

[![TouchGeometry205.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/e/ef/TouchGeometry205.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchGeometry205.gif)

U Cross Sections `uprims` - Empty by default, this field provides a way to specify a subset of the first input's faces and surfaces. Do so by selecting one or more primitive groups from this field's pop-up menu.
V Cross Sections `vprims` - Empty by default, this field provides a way to specify a subset of V faces. If a second input exists, the primitive groups available for selection are taken from the second input. If only the first input is present, the groups listed in the pop-up menu belong to the first input. This means that two inputs are not always needed for a bilinear skin as long as the first input has both U and V groups in it.
Connectivity `surftype` - ⊞ - (Results only viewable for polygons and meshes).

Preserve Shape `keepshape` - This parameter determines the precision of a linear skin (case c in the diagram). If enabled, it ensures that the generated surface goes through each cross-section. Here, a cross-section can be a face or a surface boundary, depending on the types being skinned. If disabled, Preserve Shape produces a surface whose CVs coincide with the CVs of the cross-sections (after they have being converted to a common type and an identical number of CVs). The skinning algorithm is faster with shape preservation OFF, but it lacks precision.

Skinning with shape preservation ON may produce unintuitive shapes when the cross-sections have many coincident CVs or are very close to each other. In this case try to jitter the CVs, vary the V Order (see below), or simply disable shape preservation.

Preserve shape is deactivated when doing bi-linear skinning.

V Wrap `closev` - ⊞ - This menu (menu: Off, On, If primitive does) setting determines whether the surface should be wrapped in the V parametric direction. The options are to open (Off), close (On), or inherit the closure type from the cross-sections. V Wrap is ignored when doing bilinear skinning.

Use V Order `force` - Enables or disables the use of the V Order parameter. If the flag is OFF, the skinned surface is built as a cubic (order 4) in V, unless fewer than four cross-sections for an open V or 3 cross-section for a closed V are given. For example, if the input consists of two faces and the V Wrap flag is OFF, the surface will be linear in V (order 2). The status of the V Order flag is irrelevant when the faces or surfaces are all polygons or meshes respectively, and when doing a bilinear skin.

Here, cross-section refers either to a face or a surface boundary, depending on the types being skinned.

V Order `orderv` - Specifies the order of the skinned surface when the V Order flag is enabled. A NURB surface of order "n" can be constructed with at least n or n-1 cross-sections, depending on whether the surface is open or closed in V respectively. A Bzier surface of the same order can be constructed with at least M\*(n-1) + 1 cross-sections if open, or M\*(n-1) cross-sections if closed. M is a non-negative, integer multiplier. The V order is ignored when the faces or surfaces are all polygons or meshes respectively, and when building a bilinear skin.
Skin `skinops` - ⊞ - Can optionally skin subgroups of n primitives or every nth primitive in a cyclical manner.

* Groups will generate 0-1 2-3 4-5
* Skipping will generate 0-2-6 and 1-3-5.

N `inc` - Determines the number of primitives to be either grouped or skipped. N2.
Keep Primitives `prim` - Determines whether the input primitives will be preserved (On) or deleted from the output (Off).
Output Polygons `polys` - If set, this flag instructs the program to convert the skinned surface(s) to polygons if the surface type is Mesh.

Slope CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Slope CHOP

The Slope CHOP calculates the slope (or "derivative" in math-speak) of the input channels.

If the input CHOP represents position, the slope can be interpreted as speed. By default, the Slope CHOP converts position to speed.

In mathematical terms, the slope is the first derivative of the channel curve. The second and third derivatives can also be calculated. The second derivative can be interpreted as acceleration (and the third derivative could be interpreted as the rate of change in acceleration).

This CHOP can be used in conjunction with the [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP") to manipulate speed or acceleration directly. You can calculate the speed or acceleration of a moving object with a Slope CHOP and manipulate it with other CHOPs. Then you can convert the new speed or acceleration curve back to position data with a Speed CHOP. You may need to adjust the starting position, since the Slope CHOP removes this information. This can be done with the use of the Constant parameters in the Speed CHOP.

The Units option causes the output to be expressed as a change in value per sample, value per frame, or value per second.

Type `type` - ⊞ - The type of slope to calculate.

* Slope `slope` - Calculates the slope of the channels.

* Acceleration `accel` - Calculates the acceleration of the channels.

* Acceleration Of Slope `slacc` - Calculates the acceleration of the slopes of the channels.

Method `method` - ⊞ - The sample pairs used to calculate the slope.

* Use Previous And Current Sample `pc` - The current sample and the sample before it are used. This is the only method applicable in realtime applications.

* Use Current And Next Sample `cn` - The current and the next samples are used.

* Use Previous And Next Sample `pn` - The previous and the next samples are used, producing slightly more continuous slopes than the other methods.

The slope at a sample is calculated by looking at the values of samples just before, at, and after it.

For the Slope Type, it needs two values, and the options are given to use three combinations, the default being to use the value at the sample and the one before. (before - current) is divided by the time between the samples (determined by the sampling rate). The slope placed in the channel is expressed in the Units of the CHOP.

For the type Acceleration, it uses three consecutive samples around the sample it is computing. The most accurate acceleration is obtained with Use Previous and Next Sample.

Slope per Sample `slopesamples` - Applies the slope to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.

Extra Information for the Slope CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Slope TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Slope TOP

The Slope TOP generates pixels that represent the difference between its value and its neighbouring pixels' values. Given that default RGBA pixel values are between 0 and 1, the value of .5 means the neighbor's values are the same as the pixel's value. Values output in the red channel that are above .5 indicate the values are increasing left-to-right. Values output in the blue channel that are above .5 indicate the values are increasing bottom-to-top.

However it's more clear if you switch the Pixel Format parameter to 32-bit float RGBA so you get a proper representation of negative numbers. Also set the Zero Point parameter to 0, and view the TOP view as Normalized Split to see a good representation of negative numbers.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[slopeTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SlopeTOP_Class "SlopeTOP Class")

Red `red` - ⊞ - Select which method is used to calculate the slope of the Red channel. Horizontal and Vertical options let you calculate the slope by sampling points horizontally or vertically.

* Horizontal Luminance `hluminance` - Uses the luminance values of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal Red `hred` - Uses the red channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal Green `hgreen` - Uses the green channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal Blue `hblue` - Uses the blue channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal Alpha `halpha` - Uses the alpha channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal RGB Average `hrgbaverage` - Uses the combined RGB average of the image to calculate slope.

* Horizontal RGBA Average `haverage` - Uses the combined RGBA average of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical Luminance `vluminance` - Uses the luminance values of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical Red `vred` - Uses the red channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical Green `vgreen` - Uses the green channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical Blue `vblue` - Uses the blue channel of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical RGB Average `vrgbaverage` - Uses the combined RGB average of the image to calculate slope.

* Vertical RGBA Average `vaverage` - Uses the combined RGBA average of the image to calculate slope.

* Neutral `neutral` - Sets that channel to the Zero Point.

* One `one` - Sets that channel to one.

* Zero `zero` - Sets that channel to zero.

Green `green` - ⊞ - Select which method is used to calulate the slope of the Green channel. Horizontal and Vertical options let you calculate the slope by sampling points horizontally or vertically.

Blue `blue` - ⊞ - Select which method is used to calulate the slope of the Blue channel. Horizontal and Vertical options let you calculate the slope by sampling points horizontally or vertically.

Alpha `alpha` - ⊞ - Select which method is used to calculate the slope of the Alpha channel. Horizontal and Vertical options let you calculate the slope by sampling points horizontally or vertically.

Zero Point `zeropoint` - Sets the value to output when the slope is zero, similar to a midpoint. Default is .5 since 8-bit pxels are 0 to 1. But with Pixel Format et to 32-bit Float you should set this to 0, and look at the view in Normalized Split mode.
Strength `strength` - Set the strength of the output using this multiplier. Higher values result in higher slope values.
Sample Step `offset` - ⊞ - When sampling the image, this determines the distance from each pixel to the sample pixel. When units are set to pixels, it is the number of pixels away from the current pixel which is sampled to find edges. A Sample Step of 3 would sample pixels 3 pixels away to look for edges.

Sample Step Unit `offsetunit` -

SocketIO DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# SocketIO DAT

The SocketIO DAT connects to a [Socket.IO](https://docs.derivative.ca/Socket.IO "Socket.IO") server at the specified URL.

Additional headers can be specified via the first input of the SocketIO DAT. This input should be in a table format with two columns, structured as name/value pairs.

The SocketIO DAT listens to specific events that the server emits. These events are added as listeners via the second input, structured as a single column of event names. Then, when the server emits these events the `onReceiveEvent` callback will be triggered.

The SocketIO DAT can also emit events to the server. This is done using the python `emit` method. Acknowledgement callbacks are not supported.

The SocketIO DAT is built with [socket.io's C++ Client API](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client-cpp) v3.1.0 and works with socket.io v3 or v4 servers.

The SocketIO DAT prints socket.io status messages to the TouchDesigner text console. The text console can be enabled by setting the environment variable `TOUCH_TEXT_CONSOLE=1` (see: [https://docs.derivative.ca/Variables#System\_Environment\_Variables](Variables.html#System_Environment_Variables)). The text console will open the next time TouchDesigner is launched.

SOP to CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# SOP to CHOP

The SOP to CHOP uses a [geometry object](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") to choose a [SOP](SOP.html "SOP") from which the channels will be created. The channels are created from the point attributes of a SOP, such as the X, Y and Z of the point position.

From the SOP you can select a subset of the points using Point Groups. The set of attributes that are converted to channels are chosen using the names of the attributes seen on the Info popup of SOP tiles (middle mouse click on a SOP in a SOP network pane).

For data going the opposite direction, see the [Channel SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP").

**Note:** This CHOP works in tandem with the [Channel SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP"). Point data is modified in CHOPs as regular channel data (samples) and then fed back to geometry as point attributes through the Channel SOP.

You can use any attribute. If you look at the SOP's info by middle-mouse clicking on the SOP and there are other attributes, you can specify them. For example "pscale" will the particel scale attribute if it exists.

See [Attributes](Attribute.html "Attribute") for a complete list of attributes.

Rename Scope `renamescope` - This parameter matches each channel acquired in the Attribute Scope. There must be one name per attribute value. By default, it translates the P attribute (position of the point) to `tx`, `ty` and `tz` channels. You can use [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching") to specify multiple channels.
Transform Object `transobj` - If a transform object is specified, the point values will be represented relative to that object's origin and rotation.
Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.

# SOP to DAT

The SOP to DAT allows you to extract point, vertex and primitive (e.g. polygon) data and attributes from a SOP.

Data is output in columns, with the first column being index. The index refers to the Point or Primitive number. [Attributes](Attribute.html "Attribute") are output with column name `attrib` if it is a single value attribute, or with multiple columns named `attrib(0)`, `attrib(1)`, `attrib(2)` etc. if it is a multiple value attribute.

Sort CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Sort CHOP

The Sort CHOP re-orders the inputs channels samples by value or by random. Specifying a channel to be sorted will reorder all channels samples according to the new order. This node does not change the order of the channels relative to each other. To sort the channels relative to each other use a [Reorder CHOP](Reorder_CHOP.html "Reorder CHOP").

Additionally an index channel can be created which holds the former sample index before sorting.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[sortCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SortCHOP_Class "SortCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Sort Page

Sorting Method `method` - ⊞ - There are three different sorting methods. CHOP samples can be reordered by increasing values, decreasing values or in random order.

* Increasing Values `increasing` -

* Decreasing Values `decreasing` -

* Random `random` -

Seed `seed` - Any number, integer or non-integer, which starts the random number generator. Each number gives completely different noise patterns, but with similar characteristics.
Select Type `select` - ⊞ - Specify if the channels to be sorted will be specified by index or name.

* By Channel Indices `byindices` -

Channel Indices `indices` - Specify the index of the channel to be sorted. All not specified channels will reorder their samples according to the specified channels new sample order. If left empty, all channels will be sorted.
Channel Names `names` - Specify the name of the channel to be sorted. All not specified channels will reorder their samples according to the specified channels new sample order. If left empty, all channels will be sorted.
Index Channel `indexchannel` - Enable to output an index channel which holds the former samples location before sorting.

Speed CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Speed CHOP

The Speed CHOP converts speed (units per second) to distance (units) over a time range. More generally, you give it a rate (the CHOP input) and it outputs a cumulative value. For example, the Speed CHOP converts rotation rate (rotations per second) into the number of rotation turns. ( Math-heads recognize this as an 'integral', which calculates the area under a curve. The curve is the incoming channel values over a time range, the output is the area.)

If you send a Constant CHOP channel that has value 1 into the Speed CHOP, then the Speed CHOP output will increase by 1 every second. If you feed it -2, it will decrease by 2 every second, and if you feed it 0, the output will not change. Use a Trail CHOP to see its results. You can reset the Speed CHOP to 0 by pressing the Reset parameter, or by sending in a channel (whose value is greater than 0) into the second input.

The first input contains the channels to be 'integrated'. By default, the Speed CHOP is time-sliced, so it keeps adding/subtracting to the output each frame it cooks. If you turn off its Time Slice parameter and send it a CHOP with a fixed frame range (like a default Noise CHOP), you can see the cumulative value starting from 0.

The output is calculated by adding the input's channel values for every sample, divided by the [samples per second](CHOP.html#Parts_of_a_CHOP "CHOP") of the Speed CHOP (typically 60), starting with the sample at the Start index. Negative input values reduce the output, positive values increase it. The cumulative values are put in the output channels.

When the CHOP is reset, its output can be set to any value via the Reset Value parameter.

When the second input is used to reset the output, where the second input is greater than 0, the area is reset and held to the reset value. For example, a [Wave CHOP](Wave_CHOP.html "Wave CHOP") (which is negative half the time) when passed into the second input causes the output to be reset for half a cycle.

## Parameters - Speed Page

Order `order` - ⊞ - Determines the order of the integral to use. If the input is a velocity, a First Order integral will return the position. If the input is an acceleration, a Second Order integral will return the position, and a First Order integral will return the velocity.

* First `first` -

* Second `second` -

* Third `third` -

First Constant `constant1` - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating once.
Second Constant `constant2` - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating twice.
Third Constant `constant3` - Constant to add to the entire result after integrating three times.
Limit Type `limittype` - ⊞ - Select limit options such as loop, clamp, or zigzag from the menu. The value will remain in the range from Min to less than Max.

Minimum `min` - The minimum value the output channel can have.
Maximum `max` - The maximum value the output channel can have.
Speed per Sample `speedsamples` - Applies the speed to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).

Reset Value `resetvalue` - The channel(s) is set to this value when reset.
Reset `reset` - While On, this toggle resets the channel(s) to the Reset Value.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Click to instantly resets the channel(s) to the Reset Value.
Reset On Start `resetonstart` - While On, the Speed CHOP will reset each time the .toe file is restarted. If the Speed CHOP's value gets too large it can start stepping as when it reaches the limit of CHOP's number resolution. This is useful for projects that run for a long time, restarting the file will reset this value.

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a Speed CHOP. A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

# Splice CHOP

The Splice CHOP inserts CHOP channels connected to the second input into the channels of the first input. You can specify the start sample and length of where to remove samples.

Then the inserted data from the second input can be stretched in various ways, then spliced into the trimmed point in the channels.

You can match by channel number or channel name. Un-matched channels will have the samples in their gaps interpolate in one of three selectable ways.

To extract a sample from a CHOP, modify it and replace it at its original index, connect a Splice CHOP to the original, set Start and Trim Length where you want, turn on Output Trimmed Section, modify the result, then send that as second input to another Splice CHOP with first input from the the original CHOP, and with Start set to `op('splice1').par.start` and Trim Length set to `op('splice1').par.trimlength`.

The Splice CHOP can also smooth a section of a CHOP: Set the Start and Trim Length to that section. Give it a second input with no matching channels. Set Insert Method to Set to Trim Length, and adjust the Insert Interpolate menu.

Check [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") for these and other tricks.

Spring CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Spring CHOP

The Spring CHOP creates vibrations influenced by the input channels, as if a mass was attached to a spring.

It acts as if, for every channel, there is a mass at the end of a spring, affected by a distance from the actual position (the output of the channel at the previous frame) to the desired position (the input channel at the current frame). When the distance (output - input) is zero, there is no force and therefore no movement.

Alternately, when Input Effect is force, the input is used as a force on the spring/mass, and the CHOP reacts to this force plus the force of the spring/mass. In this case, the mass would always stabilize at value 0 if the input is a force of 0.

The damping acts to make the spring system lose energy, so that higher damping makes everything come to rest sooner.

Its behavior is best understood by feeding it a chop that steps from one constant value to another in sequence, then playing with the constants.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[springCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SpringCHOP_Class "SpringCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Spring Page

Spring Constant `springk` - The strength of the spring. Larger spring constants produce higher frequency oscillations.
Mass `mass` - The mass of the object on the end of the spring. Higher masses will produce lower frequency oscillations, have higher amplitudes, and be more resistant to damping.
Damping Constant `dampingk` - The amount of damping (resistance) applied to the spring action. Higher damping causes oscillations to die off more quickly.
Input Effect `method` - ⊞ - Determines whether the input channel(s) represents a position or a force.

* Position `disp` -

* Force `force` -

Intial Conditions from Channel `condfromchan` - If On, the initial position and velocity are calculated from the values at the beginning of the channel.
Initial Position `initpos` - The initial position of the mass attached to the spring.
Initial Speed `initspeed` - The initial velocity of the mass attached to the spring.
Intial Conditions from Channel `condfromchan` - If On, the initial position and velocity are calculated from the values at the beginning of the channel.
Reset `reset` - While On resets the spring effect of the CHOP.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly reset the spring effect.

Spring SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Spring SOP

The Spring SOP deforms and moves the input geometry using spring "forces" on the edges of polygons and on masses attached to each point.

Geometry is deformed using forces that simulate simple physics on the points and edges. A simulated "mass" is assigned to each point. Its primitive edges act as "springs" which oppose the forces, and pull the points back toward their original positions. When the springs are stretched by the forces, they try to pull the points back. The points do not stop moving when they return to their original positions, however, but continue to oscillate because of their mass, until the oscillation dies out.

Forces which act upon the points are as follows:

external force (gravity)
wind (similar to external force)
turbulence (chaotic forces)

The greater the drag value, or smaller the mass, the faster the oscillation dies out.

  + [7.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Preroll Time `timepreroll` - How many seconds of the simulation to bypass, after the reset time is reached. For example, if you put the number 33 into this field (and reset is at `$TSTART`), frame one will show the simulation that was at a time of 33 seconds. In other words, the first thirty-two seconds have been bypassed, and the time at thirty-three seconds is shifted to frame one. The first thirty-two seconds must still be calculated in order to compute the status of the points, so you will notice some delay upon reset.
Time Inc `timeinc` - The Time Inc parameter determines how often to cook the SOP. By default, this parameter is set to `1/$FPS`. This means that the SOP will cook once for every frame. When complex dynamics are involved, the SOP may require more frequent cooking for increased mathematical accuracy. To get sub-frame accuracy in the cooking, set the Time Inc to something smaller than `1/$FPS` . For example, setting the Time Inc to `0.5/$FPS` will mean that the SOP gets cooked twice for every frame.

**Note:** Never set this parameter greater than `1/$FPS`.

Accurate Moves `accurate` - This option makes the nodes move more accurately between frames by calculating their trajectories for fractional frame values.
Attractor Use `attractmode` - ⊞ - Describes how attractor points are assigned to each particle.

Reset `reset` - While On resets the spring effect of the SOP.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly reset the spring effect.

External Force `external` - ⊞ - Forces of gravity acting on the points. When drag is zero, the points can accelerate with no limit on their speed.

Wind `wind` - ⊞ - Wind forces acting on the points. Similar to external force. Using wind (and no other forces, such as turbulence), the points will not exceed the wind velocity.

## Parameters - Nodes Page

Fixed Points `fixed` - This is a point group. All points in the point group will remain unaffected by the forces. Also see the [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP") for notes on how to specify point ranges.
Fixed Points go to Source Positions `revertfixed` - Determines whether or not points in the Fixed Points group should be moved to the positions of the corresponding points in the Source geometry.
Copy Groups from Source `copygroups` - Determines if the Spring SOP should copy groups from the Source geometry at each frame. This lets you specify the name of an animating group in the Fixed Points field, and the contents of this group will be kept up to date.
Add Mass Attribute `domass` - When selected, the Mass is computed for the deforming geometry.
Mass `mass` - Mass of each point. Heavier points take longer to get into motion, and longer to stop.
Add Drag Attribute `dodrag` - When selected, the geometry is deformed by the Drag attribute.
Drag `drag` - Drag of each point.
Spring Behavior `springbehavior` - ⊞ - How the springs will behave:

* Hooke's Law `hooke` - Springs will work according to Hooke's Law. This is generally more stable than Normalized Displacement.

**Hooke's Law**: Force = Displacement Spring constant

* Normalize Displacement `normalize` - Similar to Hooke's Law except that the displacement is normalized to the original length of the Spring.

Spring Constant `springk` - The spring constant. How tight the springs are. Increase this value to make the springs tighter and thus make the object more rigid. As this number becomes higher, the springs can oscillate out of control. Decrease the Time Inc if this happens.
Initial Tension `tension` - The Initial k constant of the geometry before being deformed by the spring operation.

+ Limit Plane `limitpos` - ⊞ - The points will bounce off the limit planes when it reaches them. The six limit plane fields define a bounding cube. The default settings are one thousand units away, which is very large. Reduce the values to about one to see the effect.

Hit Behavior `hit` - ⊞ - Control over what happens when the geometry hits either the six collision planes or the collision object. The options are:

* Bounce on Contact `bounce` - Geometry will bounce upon contact with the Collision input.

* Stick on Contact `stick` - Geometry will stick to the Collision input upon contact.

Sprinkle SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Sprinkle SOP

The Sprinkle SOP is used to add [points](Point_Class.html "Point Class") to either the surface or the volume of a SOP. You can create points on a surface, or within a closed volume based on the Method menu. The Surface method keeps the distribution of points constant per unit area of surface, whereas Per-Primitive gives each primitive, usually triangles, a constant number per primitive no matter their size.

The second input is used when you are scattering on a deforming surface. You generally don't want the distribution of points to jump while deforming, so you give the deformed surface as second input and the un-deformed surface as the first input. The Sprinkle SOP will then distribute points on the un-deformed surface, and then put them on their equivalent place on the deformed surface.

# Sprite SOP

The Sprite SOP creates geometry (quad sprites) at point positions defined by the CHOP referenced in the XYZ CHOP parameter.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[spriteSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SpriteSOP_Class "SpriteSOP Class")

XYZ CHOP `xyzchop` - A CHOP with 3 channels is required to specify the X, Y, and Z position of the quad to be generated. Each sample creates 1 quad. The created quads are centered at the points defined by each sample.
Camera `camera` - The geometry will always face the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") specified here.
Width CHOP `widthchop` - A 1 channel CHOP can be specified to set the width of the quad at that sample.
Color CHOP `colorchop` - A 3 channel CHOP can be specified to set the R, G, and B color values of the quad at that sample.
Alpha CHOP `alphachop` - A 1 channel CHOP can be specified to set the alpha of the quad at that sample.
Perspective Width `perspectivewidth` - The width of the geometry created. This parameter only has an effect when the Use Constant Width is less that 1.0.
Use Constant Width `constantwidth` - This blends between using Perspective Width and Constant Width. When Use Constant Width = 0, width is determined only by Perspective Width, when Use Constant Width = 1, width is determined only by Constant Width parameters below.
Constant Width Near `constantwidthnear` - The width used for quads located at a position Constant Width Falloff Start or closer.
Constant Width Far `constantwitdhfar` - The width used for quads located at a position Constant Width Falloff End or farther.
Constant Width Falloff Start `falloffstart` - At this position the or closer the geometry uses the Constant Width Near parameter for its width.
Constant Width Falloff End `falloffend` - At this position the or farther the geometry uses the Constant Width Far parameter for its width.

**NOTE**: Inbetween Falloff Start and Falloff End the width is determined using a half-cosine falloff between the two values.

# SSAO TOP

The SSAO TOP performs Screen Space Ambient Occlusion on the output of a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") or [Render Pass TOP](Render_Pass_TOP.html "Render Pass TOP"). Because this technique requires access to the [Depth Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Depth_Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Depth Buffer (page does not exist)"), no other TOP can be in between the Render/RenderPass TOP and the SSAO TOP. Screen Space Ambient Occlusion is a real-time rendering trick that creates an approximation of ambient occlusion by using the [Depth Buffer](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Depth_Buffer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Depth Buffer (page does not exist)") of the rendered scene. It is done as 2D post-processes, so the complexity of the scene has no bearing on how expensive it is. This is in comparison to true ambient occlusion which becomes more expensive with each new object that is rendered. There are two parts to a SSAO technique. First a SSAO pass is done that determines how much ambient occlusion each pixel is affected by. This result tends to be very noisy. A blur operation is then performed to even out this noise.

## Parameters - SSAO Page

Quality `quality` - ⊞ - Determines the visual quality of the results. The higher the quality, the more computationally expensive it is.

Sample Directions `sampledirs` - For each pixel, rays are sent out in random directions to see if there is a surface nearby that would occlude the ambient light to this pixel. This parameter controls how many rays are sent out per pixel.
Sample Steps `samplesteps` - Since this is a 2D pixel-based operation, the rays need to sample multiple neighboring pixels along its path to check for points of interest. This parameter controls how many of these samples each ray does.
Surface Avoid Angle `surfaceavoid` - This parameter biases the angle of the rays so they don't travel too close to the plane that the starting point lays on (as determined by the point's normal).
SSAO Pass Resolution `ssaopassres` - ⊞ - The SSAO pass can be set to Full, Half, or Quarter the resolution of the input image.

SSAO Radius `ssaoradius` - The distance it searches from the current point for occluders (in object space units).
Contrast `contrast` - Controls the contrast of the SSAO contribution.
Attenuation `attenuation` - Controls the attenuation of the ambient lighting.
Edge Threshold `edgethresh` - To avoid the ambient occlusion from bleeding across the edges of objects onto other objects, an edge detect is done using the depth buffer to figure where one object ends and the next one begins. This parameter controls how sensitive the edge detection is.
Blur Radius `blurradius` - The amount of blur in pixels.
Blur Sharpness `blursharpness` - Controls the sharpness of the blur operation.
Combine with Color `combinewithcolor` - By default the final ambient occlusion result will be multiplied by the color output of the Render TOP. You can just output the ambient occlusion results by turning this parameter off.

* Input 0:  - Must be either a [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") or a [Render Pass TOP](Render_Pass_TOP.html "Render Pass TOP").

# Stitch SOP

The Stitch SOP is used to stretch two curves or surfaces to cover a smooth area. It can also be used to create certain types of upholstered fabrics such as cushions and parachutes.

If a second input is given, it must contain one surface that the primitives in the first input can stitch to. The left input can contain either faces or surfaces; in either case, each primitive in the first input is stitched to a parametric area of the surface in the second input in such a way that the parametric area allocated to each primitive is the same and the size of all areas added together equals the parametric range specified in the R Width (see below).

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[stitchSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/StitchSOP_Class "StitchSOP Class")

Group `group` - Which primitives to stitch. If blank, it stitches the entire input. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Stitch `stitchop` - ⊞ - Stitches sub-groups of n primitives or patterns of primitives.

N `inc` - The value entered for N determines the pattern of primitives stitched.
Wrap Last to First `loop` - If enabled, it connects the beginning of the first primitive in the left input to the end of the last primitive in the same input. If only one primitive exists, its ends will be stitched together.
Direction `dir` - ⊞ - Allows stitching along either the U or V parametric direction.

Tolerance `tolerance` - This parameter minimizes modification to the input sources. A smaller value creates less modification.
Bias `bias` - Determines which primitive remains unaffected. The values go from `0 - 1`, where `0` - first, and `1` - last.
Left UV `leftuv` - ⊞ - Point on each left / right primitive at which to begin / end the stitch.

Right UV `rightuv` - ⊞ - Point on each left / right primitive at which to begin / end the stitch.

LR Width `lrwidth` - ⊞ - The first value represents the width of the left stitch. The second value represents the width of the right stitch.

Stitch `dostitch` - If selected, move a single row from each primitive to coincide.
Tangent `dotangent` - If selected, modifies neighbouring rows on each primitive to create identical slopes at the given rows.
Sharp Partials `sharp` - If selected, creates sharp corners at the ends of the stitch when the stitch partially spans a primitive.
Fixed Intersection `fixed` - When the tangent option is on, this option allows some flexibility as to which side of each slope is modified.
LR Scale `lrscale` - ⊞ - Use this parameter to control the direction and position of the tangential slopes.

StorageManager Class - Derivative

# StorageManager Class

**StorageManager** is a Python utility class designed to make [Storage](Storage.html "Storage") easy to use in Python [Extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions"). It also has a number of useful features for creating Python properties and dependable collections. Although StorageManager performs some complex Python tasks, using it in your extension is easy, and this article will give you a working knowledge of its use. An intermediate understanding of Python is assumed throughout.

**TIP:** if you want to use the property and dependability features of StorageManager, but don't need the values to be kept in [Storage](Storage.html "Storage") (between saves and extension initializations), consider using the **createProperty** function in [TDFunctions](TDFunctions.html "TDFunctions").

**For technical class details see [TDStoreTools](TDStoreTools.html#StorageManager_Class "TDStoreTools")**

  + [3.1 Access via StorageManager Object](#Access_via_StorageManager_Object)
  + [3.2 Access via Properties](#Access_via_Properties)
* [4 Limitations to StorageManager](#Limitations_to_StorageManager)

## Adding StorageManager to an Extension[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Adding StorageManager to an Extension")]

StorageManager is meant for use in Python [extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions"). The common way to include it in your extension is as follows:

```
from TDStoreTools import StorageManager

class ExampleExt:
	def __init__(self, ownerComp):
		# The component to which this extension is attached
		self.ownerComp = ownerComp

storedItems = [
			# Stored Items List goes here
		]
		self.stored = StorageManager(self, ownerComp, storedItems)

Notice that the import statement at the top imports StorageManager. Then, in the `__init__` method, a `storedItems` list is created. This list contains dictionaries of information about each item to be stored. We then pass the extension (`self`), the component whose storage will be used (`ownerComp`), and the `storedItems` list to the `StorageManager` class constructor.

## The Stored Items List[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: The Stored Items List")]

The most important thing for you to set up when using StorageManager is the **stored items list**. Each entry in the list contains an **item dictionary** with information about the item to be stored. There are five keys which can be defined in each item's dictionary:

* **name** - the name of the item to be stored. This is the only required key. If lower case, this stored value's *property* will not be [promoted](Extensions.html#Promoting_Extensions "Extensions").
* **default** - the default value of the item to be stored. If not provided, `None` will be used.
* **property** - if True, an associated property will be created to access this value. More on this below. Defaults to True.
* **readOnly** - if True, the created property will be a read only value. No effect if *property* key is false. Defaults to False.
* **dependable** - if True, the value will be [deeply dependable](TDStoreTools.html#Deeply_Dependable_Collections "TDStoreTools") if it is a container. Non-containers are always dependable and this has no effect. Defaults to False.

The items defined in this list will be created in your Component's [Storage](Storage.html "Storage") dictionary, and will thus be saved on disk when your .toe is saved. They will also retain their values when your extension is reinitialized. Let's look at some example item dictionaries before going into further detail about each dictionary attribute:

```
{'name': 'Value0'}

# A stored value called "Value0". Default values will be used for other

# dictionary keys, so it is exactly equivalent to:
{'name': 'Value0', 'default': None, 'property': True, 'readOnly': False, 'dependable': False}

{'name': 'value0', 'default': 23}

# A stored value much like "Value0" above, but it won't be promoted, and its

# starting value will be 23.

{'name': 'ValueList', 'default': [1, 8, 42], 'dependable': True}

# A stored, deeply dependable list that will start with contents [1, 8, 42]

{'name': 'ID', 'readOnly': True}

# A stored value called "ID" whose promoted property will be read only.

{'name': 'Internal', 'property': False}

# A stored value called "Internal" that will not be accessible via property,

# but only through Component storage or the StorageManager object.

## Accessing Stored Items[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Accessing Stored Items")]

There are a number of ways to access items stored by StorageManager, depending on the way the items are set up in the stored item list. For the following examples, let's say that you have an extension set up like this:

storedItems = [
			{'name': 'value0'},
			{'name': 'Value1', 'default':0},
			{'name': 'ID', 'readOnly': True},
			{'name': 'Internal', 'property': False}
		]
		self.stored = StorageManager(self, ownerComp, storedItems)

### Access via StorageManager Object[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Access via StorageManager Object")]

All stored items are available via the StorageManager object itself, which operates like a dictionary keyed by the stored items' names. As an example, here is a function that would work in ExampleExt to print and increment `Value1`:

```
	def changeValue(self):
		print(self.stored['Value1'])
		self.stored['Value1'] += 1

Stored items can be read and written in this way whether or not they are defined as read only or having a property associated with them.

### Access via Properties[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Access via Properties")]

If a stored item has a property associated with it, it can be accessed more directly. A stored item's property will have the same name as the stored item, so, duplicating the example above, `Value1` can also be accessed in this way:

```
	def changeValue(self):
		print(self.Value1)
		self.Value1 += 1

If the stored item is set up as **read only**, it cannot be changed through its property. Looking back to the extension definition above, notice that the `ID` stored value is set to read only. This means that you can do something like

`print(self.ID)`

but

`self.ID = 5`

would cause an error. If you want to change `ID`, you'd do it like this:

`self.stored['ID'] = 5`

If your extension is **[promoted](Extensions.html#Promoting_Extensions "Extensions")**, any members or methods that start with a capital letter will be accessible directly via the Component they are attached to. This is true of properties as well, so if `ExampleExt` were promoted on a Component in root named "exampleComp", you could do something like this:

`op('/exampleComp').Value1 = 12`

**Note:** in our example extension, this method of access would not work with `value0` because it is lower case, with `ID` because it is read only, or with `Internal` because it has no property associated with it.

## Limitations to `StorageManager`[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=StorageManager_Class&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Limitations to StorageManager")]

Only objects that can be saved by Python can be stored using `StorageManager`. This includes most built-in Python objects, but does not include many TouchDesigner objects, notably Operators. If you want to store an Operator, the easiest way is to store its `path` instead. You will get an error if you attempt to store a dis-allowed object.

# Stretch CHOP

The Stretch CHOP preserves the shape of channels and the sampling rate, but resamples the channels into a new interval. All data in the range is stretched or compressed to the new start and end positions.

A Reverse Interval parameter reverses the order of the samples of each channel.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[stretchCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/StretchCHOP_Class "StretchCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Stretch Page

Interpolation `interp` - ⊞ - The interpolation method to use when resampling.

* Linear `linear` - Use linear interpolation between samples when the interval is lengthened. Averages all samples near the new sample when the interval is shortened.

Constant Area `constarea` - If enabled, keeps the area under the channel constant by scaling the values of the channel.
Unit Values `relative` - ⊞ - Determines how Start/End parameters are interpreted:

Start `start` - The CHOP's new start position.
Start Unit `startunit` -
End `end` - The CHOP's new end position.
End Unit `endunit` -
Length Scale `scale` - Scales the length of the channel after determining the start/end interval. Good for doubling or halving the length.
Reverse Interval `reverse` - Reverses the channel so that it plays backwards.

Extra Information for the Stretch CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Stype Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Stype Out CHOP

The Stype Out CHOP sends camera tracking information, including position, orientation and lens information, to an external device or program over the network using the Stype HF protocol. This can be used to emulate a physical [Stype](https://www.stype.tv/) camera or to send data to another program/device that can process Stype tracking data. Data packets are sent out once per frame based on the current data in the CHOP channels. If one of the expected channels is not found in the input, then a default value will be sent.

The channels used by the Stype Out CHOP are:

*recording* - 1 or 0, indicating the recording status on the Stype Kit (see Stype protocol for more information)
*focus\_distance* - 1 or 0, indicating how the focus field is used (see Stype protocol for more information)

Subdivide SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Subdivide SOP

The Subdivide SOP takes an input polygon surface (which can be piped into one or both inputs), and divides each face to create a smoothed polygon surface using a Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm. Especially useful for avoiding the angular appearance often associated with polygonal models - without adding lots of extra geometry to the entire object. For best results, polygons should be convex and relatively uniform in distribution.

Subdivision surfaces also allows you to create the smoothed surface based on a polygon control shape. As the control shape changes, so does the smooth shape within.

## Creases and Cracks

### Creases

Creases control the strength of pull of the polygon faces on the subdivision surfaces, much like a magnet drawing the surface towards the reference polygon. They can be applied selectively using the Creases field to specify an input group to use.

Creases work by controlling the strength of the pull of the polygon faces on the subdivision surfaces, like a magnet drawing the surface towards the reference polygon. The figure below shows the result of setting the Crease Weight to `0, 1, 2` reading from left to right. As the weight increases so the pull effect strengthens and the shape approaches the reference polygon.

[![Subdivision-Creases.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/5/5e/Subdivision-Creases.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Subdivision-Creases.gif)

### The Crease Algorithm

If there is a second input:

If the Override button is enabled, each edge defined in the second input will have its edge crease weight set to the value of the override.
If the vertex attribute "`creaseweight`" exists on the second input, each matching edge in the input will have its crease weight set to the maximum of the vertex attributes for any shared edges.
If the primitive attribute "`creaseweight`" exists on the second input, each polygon in the second input will set matching edges to the appropriate weights.

If there is no second input:

If an override is specified, the value of the override is used for all edges in the sub-divided surface.
If the vertex attribute "`creaseweight`" exists, this attribute will be used to define the crease weights on the edges of the surface.
If the primitive attribute "`creaseweight`" exists, this attribute will be used to define the crease weights for the subdivision surface.

When defining crease weights on shared edges, the maximum of the weights of the shared edges is used. For example, if two polygons share an edge and the primitive attribute is used, the maximum of the crease weight will be used for the shared edge.

### Closing Cracks

Cracks can be closed by either Pull Cracks Closed or Stitch Cracks Together, so only one of these two options can be chosen at a time from the Surrounding Faces parameter. Bias applies only to Pulling, and is disabled when Stitching is chosen.

A crack is formed by a single edge on the non-subdivided area and multiple edges on the subdivided area. The Surrounding Faces menu determines what will will happen to the single edge on the non-subdivided area, and in more generally, to the polygon containing this edge.

If No Edge Division is chosen and cracks are pulled closed, all the points on the subdivided edges are pulled (i.e. moved) to the closest points on the non-subdivided edges. Bias is disabled, when No Edge Division is specified.

If cracks are pulled with the Divide Edges option, the non-subdivided edge is split into many sections, so that each each point on the non-subdivided edge now corresponds to a new point on the subdivided edge. Then, points on the newly divided edge are joined with the points on the subdivided boundary. A Bias of `1` will place these joined points along the subdivided boundary. A Bias of `0` will place them along the non- subdivided boundary (and values between 0 and 1 will place them somewhere inbetween).

Pulling cracks with the Triangulate option will do exactly the same thing as Divide Edges, except it will also triangulate the non-subdivided polygon. This is desirable because pulling the non-subdivided boundary towards the curved subdivided boundary will likely generate a non-planar polygon, so Triangulate will divide this polygon into smaller (planar) ones. Pulling cracks with a Bias of `1` and triangulating usually produces the nicest results.

The Triangulate option is necessary because the [Divide SOP](Divide_SOP.html "Divide SOP") is not designed to handle (very) non-planar polygons.

The Stitch Cracks Together option, on the other hand, inserts new polygons (triangles) to close up the cracks. When No Edge Division is chosen, many triangles are created, each having one vertex on one point of the non-subdivided edge.

When Divide Boundary Edges is chosen, the non-subdivided edge is divided, so there are more points available to be used for triangles. The resulting triangles are more regularly shaped (not as long and skinny). The Triangulate option will again triangulate the non-subdivided polygon, although this option is less likely to be used becuase this polygon should remain planar during stitching.

Group `subdivide` - Subset of input to use as a polygonal mesh to subdivide. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Creases `creases` - This field allows you to specify a subset of the second input to use as creases. The elements of the second input specified by the Creases field are used as creases. Each edge in a crease polygon corresponds to the edge in the polygon mesh which has the same point numbers. Point position is irrelevant. For polygon edges to be classified as the same edge, they must share the same points. Merely being physically close is not sufficient.

The primitive attribute `creasesharpness` is used to determine the sharpness of the specified creases unless overridden.

Depth `iterations` - How many iterations to subdivide. Higher numbers give a smoother surface.
Override Crease Weight Attribute `overridecrease` - Determine if the crease sharpness should be determined by the primitive or vertex `creaseweight` attribute or by overridden by this SOP.
Crease Weight `creaseweight` - If the crease weight is overriden, this is the weight used.

**Tip:** The default is to have the **Override Crease Weight Attribute** enabled. So you can simply set a value which applies to all the creases. You can, however, set a crease attribute using the Vertex or Primitive SOPs which allows for more control.

Generate Resulting Creases `outputcrease` - If any creases are sharper than the Depth, they will be left over in the resulting geometry. With this parameter enabled, these left over creases are created with the appropriate primitive attribute values, and placed in the specified group.
New Group `outcreasegroup` - Name of the group to place the generated creases into.
Close Cracks `closeholes` - ⊞ - Choose how gaps are handled in the output geometry.

* Do Not Close `noclose` - Don't close cracks.

* Pull Cracks Closed `pull` - Move points on boundary of subdivided area in order to close cracks formed during the subdivision.

* Stitch Cracks Together `stitch` - Add polygons (triangles) to close the cracks caused by subdividing.

Surrounding Faces `surroundpoly` - ⊞ - Choose how to handle the polygons on either side of a crack when pulling or stitching it closed.

* No Edge Division `nodiv` - When No Edge Division is chosen, many triangles are created, each having one vertex on one point of the non-subdivided edge.

* Divide Edges `edges` - Divides edges surrounding the subdivided area when pulling or stitching cracks by inserting new polygons (triangles) to close up the cracks.

* Triangulate `triangulate` - Does exactly the same thing as Divide Edges, except it also triangulates the non-subdivided polygon. This is desirable because pulling the non-subdivided boundary towards the curved subdivided boundary will likely generate a non-planar polygon, so Triangulate will divide this polygon into smaller (planar) ones. Pulling cracks with a Bias of 1 and triangulating usually produces the nicest results.

Bias `bias` - Determines which points are moved when pulling crack closed.

* 0 means move points on subdivided area to meet boundary.
* 1 means move points on boundary to meet subdivided area.

Below, a Subdivide SOP is used to create a subdivision surface from a [Box SOP](Box_SOP.html "Box SOP"). The Depth of the subdivision is set to 2. The [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP") consolidates the points so that the box faces are treated as a unit.

# Substance TOP

There is a tight integration between TouchDesigner and [Allegorithmic (Adobe) Substance Designer](http://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-designer), a material creation package that is also node-based and has extensive material libraries. The Substance TOP allows you to load `.sbsar` files from [Substance Designer](https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-designer) to use with the [PBR Material](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT").

The Substance TOP will load a material from a `.sbsar` file saved out from Substance Designer giving you access to all the parametric settings of the material inside TouchDesigner via automatically-generated parameters. Adjusting the parameters in TouchDesigner causes the materials to update on the fly.

The Substance TOP outputs multiple images, one for each layer, typically five or more for base color, roughness, metallic, etc. The Substance TOP can be dragged to the PBR material which assigns all the layers to the appropriate PBR layers. Alternately, the [Substance Select TOP](Substance_Select_TOP.html "Substance Select TOP") can extract a single layer to which you can apply any TOP image operations, then assign the result to one of the PBR layer parameters.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[substanceTOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SubstanceTOP_Class "SubstanceTOP Class")

Surfsect SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Surfsect SOP

The Surfsect SOP performs boolean operations with NURBS and Bezier surfaces, or only generates profiles where the surfaces intersect. The individual surfaces do not need to be solids (i.e. wrap in U and V), nor do they need to form a solid as a group (for example, you can cut a grid with a sphere).

The surfaces in the first input are denoted by "A" in the parameter list. The surfaces in the second input are denoted by "B". The entire A set is intersected with the B set, which allows for true csg operations with spline surfaces. Thus, if A forms a solid and B forms a solid, any boolean operation between A and B will produce a solid. If either set has an open topology, the result will also be open.

What is deemed to be the inside and outside of a trim region depends on the direction of the surface normals. If necessary, use the [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP") to reverse the surface normals by reversing the surface's U or V direction.

# Sweep SOP

The Sweep SOP sweeps primitives in the Cross-section input along Backbone Source primitive(s), creating ribbon and tube-like shapes. The cross-section primitives are placed at each point of the backbone perpendicular to it. The Backbone Source can have one or several primitives. If there is more than one, Sweep will sweep the cross section along each one.

A backbone is a primitive curve that can be open or closed, but must have at least two points. The cross section input can also have multiple primitives, and can be assigned to the backbone in various ways. The origin of the cross section primitive is placed at a point on the backbone by default, but you can also choose a point number of the cross section to place. In most cases, it is best to build 1the cross section primitives in the XY plane; Sweep will automatically orient them properly along the backbone. The orientation of the cross section is based on the direction of the backbone line segment and the positive Z axis. So vertical movement in the backbone will result in the cross section rotating around backbone axis. For example, if you create the cross section in the XY plane, you can maintain its orientation (+Y Up) by building the backbone in the XZ plane.

If the backbone primitive(s) have point colors or texture coordinates, they will be maintained and applied to the cross section primitives.

## Parameters - Sweep Page

X-Section Group `xgrp` - You can use only a subset of primitives from the Cross-section inputs by specifying a group here.
Path Group `pathgrp` - You can use only a subset of primitives from the Backbone inputs by specifying a group here.
Reference Group `refgrp` - You can use only a subset of primitives from the Reference inputs by specifying a group here.
Cycle Type `cycle` - ⊞ - Determines the Cycle Type based on these menu options.

Angle Fix `angle` - Attempts to fix buckling twists that may occur when sweeping.
Fix Flipping `noflip` - Attempts to fix buckling twists that may occur when sweeping by fixing flipped normals.
Remove Coincident Points on Path `skipcoin` - When selected, any points right on top of one another will be ignored.
Aim at Reference Points `aimatref` - Reference Points are used in conjunction with the backbone to control the orientation of the elements along the sweep. This is done by drawing a line between the reference point and corresponding backbone point in order to determine an angle vector which determines the orientation of the cross-section profiles. Enable this parameter to allow this behaviour.

**Note:** In order for this to work, you must supply **Reference Points** via the third input, and there must be exactly the same number of **Reference Points** as there are points in the **Backbone**.

Use Vertex `usevtx` - Use vertex number of the incoming cross-section to place the cross-section on the backbone.
Connection Vertex `vertex` - Specify a specific vertex to connect to the backbone.
Scale `scale` - Scales the cross sections globally.
Twist `twist` - Cumulative rotation of the cross sections around the backbone. If a value of five is specified, the cross section at the first point of the backbone is rotated five degrees, the next ten degrees, the next fifteen degrees and so on.
Roll `roll` - Non-cumulative rotation of the cross sections around the backbone. All cross sections get the same rotation.

**Note:** The **Scale**, **Twist** and **Roll** parameters can now be controlled directly by points' attributes of the same names. Thus, combined with the [Channel SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP"), those parameters can now be controlled dynamically. You can use scale and other attributes coming in to taper.

Create Groups `newg` - Selecting this option enables the creation of groups. A group is created for each backbone that is incoming. This allows for easy skinning in the [Skin SOP](Skin_SOP.html "Skin SOP").
Sweep Groups `sweepgrp` - Specify the name of your output groups in this field.
Skin Output `skin` - ⊞ - Determines the output based on these menu options.

* Off `off` - Doesn't skin the output.

* On `on` - Skins the output.

* On with Auto Close `auto` - Closes the skinned mesh if the path curve which it follows is also closed. This allows you to close primitives properly.

**Tip:** There is a way of speeding the skinning of many points using the second input of the [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP"). Suppose you have Thousands of proceedurally animated curves you wish to skin with the Sweep SOP - rather than performing a skining operation after the animation, make a second set of unanimated geometry that is preskinned. Then assuming your have a matching number of points you can just swap in the animated points into the skinned geometry.

This technique is significantly faster than using the Skin Output option of the Sweep SOP, or a Skin SOP following the Sweep SOP.

Fast Sweep `fast` - Enables an optimized skinning technique which speeds up output from 2 - 4 times in many cases at the expense of accuracy. In order for it to work correctly, the input topologies must remain consistent between cooks and each cross-section must have the same number of vertices.

Extra Information for the Sweep SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Switch CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Switch CHOP

The Switch CHOP allows you to control the flow of channels through a CHOPnet. It selects one of the input CHOPs by index and copies it exactly. This is useful for selecting one of several "gestures" or actions. Only one input chop can be selected at a time.

Inputs are indexed starting at 0, so that the first input is 0, the second is 1, and so on.

If the First Input Is Index parameter is enabled, the first input is used as the "switch" and the remaining inputs will be selection choices. In this case, the second input will be indexed as 0, the third as 1, the fourth as 2, and so on (the Switch input chop is not indexed). The index value is determined by evaluating the first channel in the first input at the current frame. Only integer indices are used; fractional indices will be rounded down to the closest integer.

If the index is less than 0, then the index will be interpreted to be 0. If the index is greater than the number of input chops, the last input chop is selected.

If you wish to blend between inputs use the [Cross CHOP](Cross_CHOP.html "Cross CHOP") or the [Blend CHOP](Blend_CHOP.html "Blend CHOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[switchCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/SwitchCHOP_Class "SwitchCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Switch Page

First Input is Index `indexfirst` - If enabled, it will use the first input CHOP's first channel to determine which input to select.
Index `index` - The input index to use if First Input Is Index is off.

Extra Information for the Switch CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Sync In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Sync In CHOP

The Sync In CHOP and [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") are used to keep timelines in two or more TouchDesigner processes within a single frame of each other. One process will contain a [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") while one or more other processes contain Sync In CHOPs. The processes with Sync In CHOPs should have their **Realtime flag checked off**, as their frame rates will be determined by the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP"). Also note, all monitors (including all clients and server) should be set to the **same rate**. Note that unplugging or re-adding monitors may sometime change previously configured settings.

The CHOPs synchronize by pausing their own timeline until all Sync In/Out CHOPs have cooked. The [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") will be ahead of the Sync In CHOPs. If any CHOPs fail to communicate, the others will timeout, causing all processes to run slowly.

Client machines may come online at any point, or be switched off as desired, as the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") will adjust accordingly, either timing out, temporarily or permanently banning individual clients as specified.

In addition any extra CHOP channels sent through the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") is received by the Sync In CHOPs.

An [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT"), pointing to the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP"), provides a detailed list of all clients:

The columns are:

* `pid`: process id of the client
* `address`: ip and port number
* `machine_name`: client machine name
* `filename`: name of the `.toe` file the client resides in
* `op_path`: full operator path to the client
* `include`: when 1, the Sync Out CHOPs waits for a reply, when 0, it is ignored.
* `timeout_total`: The total number of times the Sync Out CHOP stalled waiting for this client
* `timeout_consecutive`: The running number of times the Sync Out CHOP stalled waiting for this client.
* `steady_total`: The total number of times the Sync Out CHOP received a reply in time.
* `steady_consecutive`: The running number of times the Sync Out CHOP received a reply in time:
* `reply`: The last reply from the client, all clients should have the same increasing value.

Similarly, an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") will reveal further information: [Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)

## Example Files[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_CHOPs_Common&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Example Files")]

Here are two simple example files that use Sync In and Out CHOPs. You would run the SyncServer.toe only once, and run the SyncClient.toe for every machine you want to display on. Note that you may need to adjust the [Window COMP](Window_COMP.html "Window COMP") located at /perform to output to your desired monitor. Also note that [Hardware Frame Lock](Hardware_Frame_Lock.html "Hardware Frame Lock") is not enabled in these examples, so if you want to use that feature you'll need to turn that parameter on in the [Window COMP](Window_COMP.html "Window COMP") for SyncClient.toe as well.

[File:SyncServer.toe](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:SyncServer.toe "File:SyncServer.toe")  
[File:SyncClient.toe](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:SyncClient.toe "File:SyncClient.toe")

## Intermittent Connections[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_CHOPs_Common&action=edit&section=T-2 "Edit section: Intermittent Connections")]

Whenever a client replies, it is immediately assumed reliable, and waited upon, by the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") each frame thereafter.
When a client times-out a number of times in a row, however, it is continuously ignored by the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP"), until it replies on time again.
This also applies to clients that have stopped communicating altogether.
The number of consecutive timeouts is controlled by the `Client Timeouts (consecutive)` parameter and is reflected by the `timeout_consecutive` [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") column.

## Fixing Dropped frames on Client[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_CHOPs_Common&action=edit&section=T-3 "Edit section: Fixing Dropped frames on Client")]

If a particular client is dropping frames, inspect the Sync Out CHOP on the server side with an info DAT. Look at the column for timeout\_consecutive. As well take note of the info chop channel for the sync in CHOP called sync\_incompletes. If one or both of these attributes are increasing, try adjusting the TimeOut parameter on the sync CHOP. Increasing this value has been known to remedy this issue.

## Banning[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_CHOPs_Common&action=edit&section=T-4 "Edit section: Banning")]

If a client produces unreliable communication, sometimes steady, sometimes timing out, then it can be permanently ignored by enabling `Ban Clients` and setting the `Total Timeouts` accordingly. Once a client timeouts a certain number of times, its Info DAT `include` column reports `banned` and it will always be ignored, even if it starts responding in time again.

## Resetting[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Sync_CHOPs_Common&action=edit&section=T-5 "Edit section: Resetting")]

Whenever the Sync Out CHOP first starts any and all clients are accepted, and nothing is banned. Pressing `Clear Stats` in the [Sync Out CHOP](Sync_Out_CHOP.html "Sync Out CHOP") also returns to this state, clearing all banned lists, and totals, even in the remote client [Info CHOPs](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

The Syphon Spout In TOP will obtain its texture image via shared memory from other applications that support the [Spout framework](http://spout.zeal.co/) on Windows or [Syphon](https://syphon.github.io/) on macOS. Since this uses shared memory, it only works on the computer it's running on and does not transmit textures across a network to another computer. To send textures to another computer, see [Touch In TOP](Touch_In_TOP.html "Touch In TOP") and [Touch Out TOP](Touch_Out_TOP.html "Touch Out TOP"), or [NDI In TOP](NDI_In_TOP.html "NDI In TOP") and [NDI Out TOP](NDI_Out_TOP.html "NDI Out TOP").

You can download a Spout setup package at <http://spout.zeal.co/> for testing and example applications.
You can download a [Syphon simple server](https://github.com/Syphon/Simple/releases/download/public-beta-2/Syphon.Demo.Apps.Public.Beta.2.dmg) setup to testing.

By default Spout on Windows is limited to 10 senders active on the computer. This limit can be changed by setting the Windows registry DWORD:

HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Leading Edge\\Spout\\MaxSenders

  + [13.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

## Attributes

Every cell in a Table component is described by attributes in a DAT table describing its font, size, color, etc. These attributes may be located in different tables. For each cell in the table, attributes are first searched in a corresponding cell attribute table, followed by a row attribute table, followed by a column attribute table, finally followed by a table attribute table.

These attribute tables are themselves found using a second level of lookup tables, that use the current state of the cell for that lookup. The possible cell states are:

* default
* rollover
* select
* selectrollover

The state of each cell can be examined with an Info DAT.

The attribute tables are organized as follows:

* Each row describes one attribute.
* The first column is the attribute name.
* The second column is an optional path to a [table of values](#Value_Tables) for this attribute.
* If the second column is blank, then the remaining columns contain the values for this attribute.

The current list of available attributes are:

* **type** t (field/label)
* **fieldtype** t (float/string/integer)
* **setpos** b x y (sets cell's absolute position in pixels when b=1)
* **width** w (sets cell's width in pixels, -1 is stretchy)
* **height** h (sets cell's height in pixels, -1 is stretchy)
* **offset** x y (cell position offset in pixels)
* **padding** l r b t (cell padding in pixels)
* **margin** l r b t (cell margin in pixels)
* **bgcolor** r g b a (background color)
* **borderacolor** r g b a (border A color)
* **bordera** l r b t (border A color edge source: 0=off, 1=bordera color, 2=borderbcolor)
* **borderbcolor** r g b a (border B color)
* **borderb** l r b t (border B color edge source: 0=off, 1=bordera color, 2=borderbcolor)
* **fontpath** path (Path to font. Don't use with 'font')

## Value Tables

If a path to a table of values is specified, then this table consists of one row for each cell. If your table is not in this format, it can be modified easily. For example if the value table DAT has 3x2 cells, append a [DAT to CHOP](DAT_to_CHOP.html "DAT to CHOP") followed by a [CHOP to DAT](CHOP_to_DAT.html "CHOP to DAT") .
In the CHOP, set the following parameters:

* Output: 'Single Channel'
* First Row is: 'Values'
* First Column is: 'Values'

This will produce a table with 1 column and 6 rows as required, providing all the values are numeric.

## Parameters - Table Page

Cell Attributes DAT `attributes` - A list of attribute DATs, one per cell.
Row Attributes DAT `rowattributes` - A list of attribute DATs, one per row.

Table DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Table DAT

The Table DAT lets you hand-edit or create a table of rows and columns of cells, each cell containing a text string. A "table" is one of the two forms of DATs (the other being simply lines of "free-form" text via the [Text DAT](Text_DAT.html "Text DAT")).

**Manually editing cells** - When a Table DAT has its [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active") on, you can add rows and columns by right-clicking on row 0 or column 0 to add rows/columns, and typing text into any cell of its [node viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer"). Use the Tab key to jump to the next cell, and the up/down arrow keys to navigate to adjacent cells.

**Procedurally filling cells** - You can conveniently create and fill rows and columns of a table. On the Fill page, the Fill Type menu gives 5 options: Manual, Set Size, Set Size and Contents, Fill by Column, and Fill by Row. When a Fill option is chosen, you can generate multiple rows/columns with specific headings using space-separated names or an expression, plus expressions to fill the cells.

You can use `me.subRow` and `me.subCol` (for sub-section being filled) in your expressions. See the popup menu on the Cell Expression parameter for suggestions.

Click the + below the parameters to you generate multiple sets of new cols or rows.

**Filling cells externally with python**  - If you are not auto-filling, you can put strings into table cells using something like `op('table1')[2,'select'] = 'yes'` in a python script elsewhere, or append rows using `.appendRow()` in python. See also the [Script DAT](Script_DAT.html "Script DAT") and its Snippets.

**Loading from external files** - The Table DAT can also can load a table from a `.csv`, `.txt` or `.dat` file on disk or on the web. Either drag-drop the file into a network, or use the File parameter.

Use `http://` when specifying a table on the internet.

If you drag the Table DAT to a desktop or folder, The DAT text will be converted into tab-delimited tables in a `.txt` file.

See also [Script DAT](Script_DAT.html "Script DAT"), [Text DAT](Text_DAT.html "Text DAT").

Tablet CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Tablet CHOP

The Tablet CHOP gets the [Wacom](http://www.wacom.com/) tablet X and Y values, and also gets pen tip pressure, X tilt and Y tilt, and the various pen buttons. Two pens can be used to output one set of channels for each pen. The Tablet CHOP will initialize/install when the CHOP is created.

It supports the simultaneous use of two devices (Stylus Pen, Airbrush or 4D Mouse) on the same tablet, with the "1st Pen" folder controlling the parameters of the primary device (the first one activated), and the "2nd Pen" folder controlling the parameters of the other device.

Put a channel name in a parameter to create that channel.

The range of all axes is -1.0 to 1.0. The values of the Button parameters are 0 for Button Up and 1 for Button Down. All axis and button channels are active when the Active state is On.

In most parameter fields of this CHOP, if you put a channel name in the parameter, it will attempt to read that parameter and output the channel. Otherwise no channel is created.

For advice on setting up the tablet and tuning the sensitivity of the pen and tablet, please read the [Wacom Intuos](https://docs.derivative.ca/Wacom_Intuos_Tablet "Wacom Intuos Tablet") article.

tdu Module - Derivative

# tdu Module

From Derivative
(Redirected from [TDU Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=TDU_Class&redirect=no "TDU Class"))

The `tdu` module is a generic utility module containing all miscellaneous functions that don't refer specifically to TouchDesigner data structures. `tdu` is imported by default when the application launches.

`fileTypes` → `dict` **(Read Only)**:

> A dictionary of all supported file types, organized by category.
> 
> ```
> # example of various file types accepted by Movie File In TOP
> tdu.fileTypes['movie']
> tdu.fileTypes['image']
> 
> ```
> 
> ```
> # other file types
> tdu.fileTypes['audio']
> 
> ```
> 
> Note: Acceptable file types can be both uppercase and lowercase, so if `suffix` is a suffix string, you need to force it to lowercase by using `suffix.lower()`:
> 
> ```
> for suffix.lower() in tdu.fileTypes['movie']:
> 	print(suffix)
> 
> ```

`Matrix` → `tdu.Matrix` **(Read Only)**:

> The [Matrix](Matrix_Class.html "Matrix Class") definition class.

`Dependency` → `tdu.Dependency` **(Read Only)**:

> The [Dependency](Dependency_Class.html "Dependency Class") definition class.

`FileInfo` → `tdu.FileInfo` **(Read Only)**:

> The FileInfo object takes a file path and has a few utility properties to provide additional information. It is derived from str, so will work as a Python string, but can be differentiated from a regular string by using `isinstance(tdu.FileInfo)`.
> 
> Utility properties include:
> 
> * path: filepath string
> * ext: string after and including "."
> * fileType: the TD filetype (from tdu.fileTypes)
> * absPath: the absolute path to filepath
> * dir: the containing directory of filepath
> * exists: exists in file-system
> * isDir: is a directory in the file-system
> * isFile: is a file in the file-system
> * baseName: the name of the final element in the path

`ArcBall` → `tdu.ArcBall` **(Read Only)**:

> The [ArcBall](ArcBall_Class.html "ArcBall Class") definition class.

`Camera` → `tdu.Camera` **(Read Only)**:

> The [Camera](Camera_Class.html "Camera Class") definition class.

`debug` → `module` **(Read Only)**:

> Helper module for the builtin debug statement. [Documentation.](https://docs.derivative.ca/Debug_module "Debug module")

`Timecode` → `tdu.Timecode` **(Read Only)**:

> The [Timecode](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") definition class.

`rand(seed)`→ `float`:

> Return a random value in the range [0.0, 1.0) given the input seed value. That is, it will never return 1.0, but it may return 0.0. For a given seed, it will always return the same random number. The seed does not need to be a number. If the seed is not numeric, it resolves it to its string representation to produce a unique value. In the case of OPs for example, its string representation is a constant path. Thus one can produce a unique random value for each OP which remains the same for that OP each time you reload TouchDesigner.
> 
> ```
> tdu.rand(me) # return a specific random number based on path
> tdu.rand(5) # return a specific random number
> tdu.rand(absTime.frame) # return a different number every frame
> 
> ```

`clamp(inputVal, min, max)`→ `float | int`:

> Returns the input value clamped between min and max values. Arguments can be any type that can be compared (float, int, str, etc).

`remap(inputVal, fromMin, fromMax, toMin, toMax)`→ `float`:

> 
> ```
> tdu.remap(0.5, 0, 1,  -180, 180)  #remap slider value to angle range

> 
> * str - The string to extract the base name from.
> 
> ```
> tdu.base('arm123') # returns 'arm'
> tdu.base('arm123/leg456') # returns 'leg'
> 
> ```
> 
> Note this method will work on any string, but when given a specific operator, its more efficient to use its local base member:
> 
> ```
> n = op('arm123/leg456')
> b = n.base #returns 'leg'
> 
> ```

`digits(str)`→ `int | None`:

> Returns the numeric value of the last consecutive group of digits in the string, or None if not found. The search begins after the last slash if any are present. The digits do not nessearily need to be at the end of the string.

> 
> ```

`expand(pattern)`→ `list`:

> Return a list of the expanded items, following the rules of [Pattern Expansion](Pattern_Expansion.html "Pattern Expansion").
> 
> ```

Text COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Text COMP

The Text COMP is a [panel](Panel.html "Panel") used to display text for building user interfaces. The text can be view-only, view-only but copy/pasteable, or be fully editable directly in the panel.

There are **formatting** modes for displaying single-line strings and multi-line text, floating point and integer numbers, password fields and more. The source of the text comes from the Text parameter and it is then formatted for display in the panel. Formatting examples include displaying a number as a currency, percent or scientific notation, or converting an integer timecode value to hours/minutes/seconds/frames. Other formatting options include support for Python syntax, Custom C++ Fmt and Custom Python F-String syntax.

When a user clicks in the panel to edit the text, the contents are displayed in a raw format and then formatted again once the editing is completed.

The Text COMP supports **[inline formatting directives](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes "Text Formatting Codes")** in the text for things like color, strikeouts, underlines, small caps, subscripts, gradients, etc. For example, the code `{#color(255, 0, 0);}` will turn all text that follows on that line red.

It has **text-fitting** options for wraparound, shrinking text if it doesn't fit, left-center-right alignment and language reading direction. View-only text can be selectable or not selectable.

You can draw **multiple transformed/formatted strings using a "Specification DAT" table**: It draws one string per row of the table, each with its own position and formatting in your panel. Columns can be `x`, `y`, `text`, `fontsize`, `fontcolorr`, `fontcolorg`, `fontcolorb`, `fontalpha`, `skew`, `tracking` and `horzstretch`. You can also use a Specification CHOP for the numeric values of the text attributes.

It has **python callbacks** that can be executed for every character or string that has changed, and a callback for change of focus.

**Resolution-independent text** is drawn directly to the screen at the resolution required for the panel size, resulting in perfectly crisp text at all zoom levels. It is GPU-based using the [Slug Library](Slug_Library.html "Slug Library").

Units for X, Y, Width and Height are in "**panel units**" whereas they were actual pixel units before. Default Font Size, Text Offsets and Padding are in panel units.

See [Operator Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") for examples of the Text COMP.

See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes "Text Formatting Codes")

See also [Geo Text COMP](Geo_Text_COMP.html "Geo Text COMP") for the 3D rendered equivalent of the Text COMP.

Note: The Text COMP is a replacement for the [Field COMP](Field_COMP.html "Field COMP"), completely replacing it and adding many new features not previously available.

Mode `mode` - ⊞ - Controls whether the contents are taken from the Text parameter or from a Specification DAT/CHOP.

* Specification DAT/CHOP `specdat` -

Text `text` - This parameter is the data source for the text that is displayed in the panel. The value may be a number, string, or a reference to an external data source using a python or bind expression. When the text is edited by the user in the panel, those changes will be saved back to this value or to the original data source it is bound to. For example, you can bind the text in the panel to the contents of a DAT cell using a bind expression like 'op('table1')[0,0]'
Specification DAT `specdat` - A path to a Table DAT that is the source of the text data when in Specification mode. The table should have 3 columns labeled x, y and text in their first rows. Each row after that will display one line of text at the given x, y coordinates as measured from the bottom-left corner. x and y are measured in panel units.
Specification CHOP `specchop` - A path to a CHOP that can provide numerical data when in Specification mode. Channels named x and y can be used to position the text data specified in the Specificaction DAT. Each data row in the DAT should have a corresponding sample in the CHOP.
Type `type` - ⊞ - The Type parameter controls how the value is interpreted and as well as what formatting and editing options are available.

* String `string` - The value is interpreted as a single line of text. If the source text contains multiple lines, they will be appended into one line. This mode is useful for simply labels or as an input field for data.

* Float `float` - The value is treated as a floating point number before it is formatted for display in the panel. When editing, only numeric digits are accepted.

* Integer `integer` - The value is treated as a whole integer number before it is formatted for display in the panel. When editing, only numeric digits are accepted. Integer mode can be used for formatting time codes and other whole numbers.

* Multi Line `multiline` - Use this mode when displaying longer text that spans multiple lines. Lines are broken by a new line character (\n), or they can be set to wrap at the bounds of the panel. Note: Use expression mode for the Text parameter when entering new line characters using the '\n' escape sequence. Escape sequences are ignored and treated as literals when the parameter is in constance mode.

* Password `password` - Use this mode to simulate a password box where the formatted text is replaced with dots. Note: While the password is not visible in the panel, it is not secure and is still displayed in the value parameter and is accessible with python.

* Specification DAT `specdat` - In this mode, the Text parameter is ignored and data is taken from a DAT table given in the Specification DAT parameter. This mode can be used for displaying multiple single line strings at arbitrary locations inside the panel. This mode does not support editing the text directly in the panel. The table must contain at least 3 columns labeled x, y and text in their first rows. Each subsequent row will display one line of text at the given x, y coordinates. x and y are given in panel units measured from the bottom-left. The alignment parameters can be used to position the text relative to each x, y point.

Formatting `formatting` - ⊞ - This parameter controls how the source text is is formatted and displayed inside the panel. The options available will change depending on the selected mode. For example, in Float mode there are options for scientific notation or percentage, while in Integer mode there are options to treat the source value as a time code.

* Default `default` - This option is available in all modes and applies minimal formatting to the source value.

* Custom (Fmt Syntax) `customfmt` - The text value is formatted using the c++ Fmt syntax where the source text is value 0. In Float mode, the width is also available as value 1 and the precision is value 2. See the [Fmt documentation](https://fmt.dev/latest/syntax.html) for more details.

* Custom (Python F-String Syntax e.g. {val} ) `customfstring` - The text value is formatted using the Python F-String syntax where the source text is available in the variable 'val'. In this format, anything between the curly braces is treated as a python expression, which allows easy mixing of literal text and dynamic expressions.

Custom Formatting `customformatting` - This parameter provides the formatting string for custom modes like Python F-String and C++ Fmt. In both cases, the source text is defined inside curly braces ( {} ) while text outside the braces is treated as constants.
Precision `precision` - Used in Float mode to set the number of decimal places.
Thousands Separator `thousandsseparator` - ⊞ - Used in Float and Integer mode to add a separator between thousands to make it easier to read large numbers. For example 1,000,000

* None `none` - Do not add a separator.

* Space `space` - Use a half space character to separate thousands i.e. 1 000 000

* Comma `comma` - Use a comma to separate thousands 1,000,000

Framerate `framerate` - Sets the number of frames per second when formatting integers into time codes.
Use Smart Punctuation `smartquote` - Enables the use of smart punctuation. For example, pairs of quotes will be replaced with appropriate angled quotes, 3 periods will be replaced with an ellipses character and two hypens will become an em-dash.
Formatting Codes `formatcodes` - Enables the use of formatting directives in the text. For example, the code {#color(255, 0, 0);} will turn all text afterwards on that line red. See [Text Formatting Codes](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_Formatting_Codes "Text Formatting Codes") for all available codes.
Smart Punctuation `smartpunct` - Enables the use of smart punctuation. For example, pairs of quotes will be replaced with appropriate angled quotes, 3 periods will be replaced with an ellipses character and two hypens will become an em-dash.
Word Wrap `wordwrap` - Enables word wrap and can only be used when the 'Type' parameter above is set to 'Multi Line'. Word wrap will split single lines of text onto multiple lines when they extend past the edge of the panel. The panel width is based on the Width parameter minus the left and right padding. Lines are generally broken at spaces, tabs or hypens, but can be broken mid word if a single word is longer than the page.
Edit Mode `editmode` - ⊞ - Controls whether the text can be editing directly in the viewer.

* Locked `locked` - The text is read only and cannot be edited in the viewer.

* Editable `editable` - Clicking in an active viewer will begin edit mode, allowing the text to be edited directly in the viewer. When the viewer loses focus, by clicking outside or hitting enter or escape, the contents of the viewer will be saved back to Text parameter. If the Text parameter contains a bind expression, the text will be saved back to the member on the other side of the bind i.e. another parameter, DAT cell or python attribute.

* Select Only `selectonly` - The text in the viewer can be selected and copied, but cannot be changed.

* Editable (Continuous Update) `editablecontinuous` - Similar to the 'Editable' option, but the value is saved back to the source after every key stroke rather than just after the viewer loses focus.

Shift-Enter for New Line `shiftenter` - In multiline mode, when this option is enabled, pressing Enter will complete editing and save the value and users must hold Shift and Enter if they wish to create a new line.
Reading Direction `readingdirection` - ⊞ - Use this parameter to control whether the text is displayed from left-to-right (LTR) or from right-to-left (RTL). Bidirectional layout is also supported when LTR characters are detected when using RTL mode.

* Left To Right `lefttoright` -

* Right To Left `righttoleft` -

Drag Drop Behaviour `dragdropmode` - ⊞ - This parameter controls what happens when a user drags something onto an active panel.

* Use Panel System `panel` - Use the standard drag/drop controls.

* Replace Text `textreplace` - Automatically replace the text with text contents of the object being dragged. For example, if a node is dragged onto the viewer, the text will be replaced with the path for that node.

* Append Text `textappend` - Automatically append the text contents of the object being dragged onto the current contents of the view. For example, if a node is dragged onto the viewer, the path of that node will be added to the end of the current text.

Focus Order `fieldfocus` - A path to a Table DAT containing a list of component paths that is used to control which panel receives the focus when a user hits TAB or Shift+Tab during editing.
Drag Drop Behavior `dragdropmode` - ⊞ - This parameter controls what happens when a user drags something onto an active panel.

* Use Panel System `panel` -

* Insert Text `textinsert` -

* Replace Text `textreplace` -

* Append Text `textappend` -

Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The path of a Text DAT containing python callback functions that can be used to react to different events in the viewer.

Legacy Font Selection `legacyfontselection` - Enable to select the font using the legacy system of bold and italic toggles. In the new system, bold and italic options can be chosen using the typeface parameter when available.
Font `font` - Select the font to be used from the dropdown menu. Available fonts are those that have been registered with the operating system. There may be a delay when selecting fonts that have not been used before as the system creates the necessary intermediate files required for rendering.
Font File `fontfile` - Specify a font file to be used for rendering the text. This option can be used for fonts that are not registered with the operating system and do not appear in the drop down menu.
Typeface `typeface` - ⊞ - Select a specific typeface for the current font e.g. Bold, Regular, Italic, etc. Not applicable in legacy font mode.

* Regular `Regular` -

* Italic `Italic` -

* Bold `Bold` -

* Bold Italic `Bold Italic` -

Bold `bold` - Display the text in **bold**.
Italic `italic` - Display the text in *italics*.
Drop Shadow `dropshadow` - Draw a drop shadow under the text.
Scale Text to Fit `scaletofit` - ⊞ - Automatically adjust the font size to fit inside the panel.

* Never `never` - Use the given font size and do not scale the text.

* Always `always` - Scale the text so that it fills the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the panel while still maintaining its original proportions.

* Only when Too Large `onlyshrink` - In this mode, the text is only scaled if it is too large to fit inside the panel. Text that is smaller than the panel, will remain at its original font size.

Font Size `fontsize` - Set the size of the font. By default the font is defined in resolution-independent panel units that will be rendered to a variable number of pixels depending on DPI settings of the output window (e.g. monitor scaling).
Font Size Units `fontsizeunits` - ⊞ - Determines how the font size is interpretted. The default is resolution-independent panel units.

* P `panelunits` - A resolution-independent unit that is rendered to a variable number of pixels depending on the current DPI settings of the display device.

* F `fract` - A percentage of the panel height i.e. 0.5 is 50% or half of the panel height. 1.0 would be the full height of the panel.

* Pt `points` - Set the font size using points which are defined using the Windows convention that at 100% display scaling (1 panel unit = 1 pixel), 96 pixels is 72 points or the equavalent of 1.333 panel units.

Tracking `tracking` - Sets the horizontal spacing between characters, where 0 is default spacing, > 0 is increased spacing and < 0 is decreased spacing.
Skew `skew` - Tilts the top of the characters forwards or backwards relative to the baseline.
Horz Stretch `horzstretch` - Horizontally stretch the characters relative to their current alignment.
Line Spacing `linespacing` - The spacing between lines when using multiline mode. The value is a multiplier of the default spacing which is defined as 1.2 \* font size.
Font Color `fontcolor` - ⊞ - The default color of the text. Additional colors can be applied to separate parts of the text using formatting codes.

Font Alpha `fontalpha` - The blending value used to display the text over the background. 1 is opaque while 0 is transparent.
Custom Select Color `customselectcolor` - Enable this parameter to define a custom color used for the selection bar when editing the text. When disabled, the selection color will be automatically chosen to maximize contrast between the background and text colors.
Select Color `selectcolor` - ⊞ - The color of the selection bar when Custom Select Color is enabled.

* Select Color `selectcolorr` -

* Select Color `selectcolorg` -

* Select Color `selectcolorb` -

Text Offset `textoffset` - ⊞ - An offset applied to the text position after any other alignment operations. Positive values move the text up and to the right.

* Text Offset `textoffsetx` -

* Text Offset `textoffsety` -

Text Offset Units `textoffsetunits` - ⊞ - Determine the units used by the Text Offset parameter.

Text Padding `textpadding` - ⊞ - Set the amount of space between the edges of the panel and the text. Whether the padding has an effect on the position of the text depends on the current alignment mode and whether word wrapping is used. For example, if the text is left aligned, the text will be positioned away from the left edge based on the left padding. But the text may extend any distance from the right edge depending on the length of the text. However, if word wrap is enabled in multiline mode, then the text will be wrapped at a distance from the right edge based on the padding.

Text Padding Units `textpaddingunits` - ⊞ - The units used by the text padding.

Horizontal Align `alignx` - ⊞ - Determines how the text is positioned horizontally in the panel. For example, with left alignment, the text will be positioned against the left side of the panel plus any defined padding.

Horizontal Align Mode `alignxmode` - ⊞ - Determines how the text is measured for calculating the alignment. Only font metrics are available when using Multiline or Specification DAT mode.

* Use Font Metrics `metrics` - Uses the general dimensions of the font rather than the specific characters of the text. Use this setting to maintain a constant alignment when the text may be changing.

* Use Text Bounding Box `bbox` - Uses the exact dimensions of the current string to do the alignment. This is useful when trying to align special characters like forward slashes that may not align with the standard character box.

Vertical Align `aligny` - ⊞ - Determines how the text is positioned vertically inside the panel.

* Center `center` - When using Font Metrics alignment, centering is based on the distance from the baseline to the defined ascent (usually the height of the capital Latin characters) for the font. Descending characters like 'g' or 'j' are not accounted for.

Vertical Align Mode `alignymode` - ⊞ - Determines how the text is measured when doing the vertical alignment.

* Use Font Metrics `metrics` - The vertical alignment is based on the general size of the font i.e. the font may be positioned a small distance from the bottom of the panel to account for any descending characters like 'g' or 'j' even if those characters are not present in the text. Use this setting to maintain a constant alignment when the text may be changing or is unknown.

* Use Text Bounding Box `bbox` - The vertical alignment is based on the specific characters of the text e.g. text with no descending characters may be positioned directly against the bottom edge when using bottom alignment.

Text DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Text DAT

The Text DAT lets you edit free-form, multi-line ASCII text. It is used for scripts, GLSL shaders, notes, XML and other purposes. "Free-form text" is one of the two forms of DATs (the other being tables of rows and columns of cells, each cell containing a text string as in a [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT")).

Text can be typed into the DAT when its [Viewer Active](Viewer_Active.html "Viewer Active") is on, or in an external text editor. The Text DAT can get its data from a file on disk or from a file on the web. Use `http://` when specifying a remote text file.

See also the Execute DATs which are specialized to run their text as a script: [CHOP Execute DAT](CHOP_Execute_DAT.html "CHOP Execute DAT") runs its script when a CHOP channel changes, [DAT Execute DAT](DAT_Execute_DAT.html "DAT Execute DAT") when a DAT changes, [Execute DAT](Execute_DAT.html "Execute DAT") when you start or end your TouchDesigner process or want to run a script every frame, [Panel Execute DAT](Panel_Execute_DAT.html "Panel Execute DAT") when a control panel changes, [Parameter Execute DAT](Parameter_Execute_DAT.html "Parameter Execute DAT") when a parameter of a node changes, and [OP Execute DAT](OP_Execute_DAT.html "OP Execute DAT") when anything else about an operator changes, including creation and deletion of nodes in a component's network.

Use the [Web DAT](Web_DAT.html "Web DAT") to fetch via a URL query.

Edit.. `edit` - Clicking this opens a text editor to add/edit/delete text from the DAT.
File `file` - The filesystem path and name of the file to load. Accepts `.txt` and `.dat` files.
Sync to File `syncfile` - When On, loads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts. A filename must be specified. Turning on the option will load the file from disk immediately. If the file does not exist, it will be created the first time the DAT is updated. The file is monitored so that any changes made to the file will update the DAT, and any changes made to the DAT will be written to the file right away. If the file is removed, the DAT will retain its current contents.
Load on Start `loadonstart` - When On, reloads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts.
Load File `loadonstartpulse` - Instantly reloads the file.
Write on Toe Save `write` - When On, writes the contents of the DAT out to the file on disk when the project is saved.
Write File `writepulse` - Instantly write the file to disk.

Extra Information for the Text DAT can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Bold `bold` - Displays the text in **bold**.
Italic `italic` - Displays the text in *Italic*.
Font Size X `fontsizex` - Sets the font size in X (horizontal). The font size defines the distance from the baseline to the top of the layout box for the given font. The default size of 1 of the default font is close to the vertical size of capital letters with no descenders.
Font Size Y `fontsizey` - Sets the font size in Y (vertical).
Keep Font Ratio `keepfontratio` - Ignores Y value in Font Size. Sets both X and Y size to Font Size X.
Scale Font to BBox Height `scalefontobboxheight` - Scale the font’s vertical size so it’s based on the vertical bounding box of the font.
Output `output` - ⊞ - Specify geometry output of Triangles, Closed Polygons or Open Polygons.

* Triangles `triangles` - The output is a triangulated mesh suitable for shaded renders.

* Closed Polygons (Filled Holes) `closedpolys` - The output is a set of separated closed outlines, suitable for [Laser CHOP](Laser_CHOP.html "Laser CHOP"), [Extrude SOP](Extrude_SOP.html "Extrude SOP"), etc. Append a [Hole SOP](Hole_SOP.html "Hole SOP") to preserve holes properly.

* Open Polygons `openpolys` - The output is a set of separated open outlines, suitable for the [Laser CHOP](Laser_CHOP.html "Laser CHOP"), etc. Renders as a wireframe always.

Level of Detail `levelofdetail` - Controls the quality of the text's shape by adding/removing subdivisions to the geometry.
Language `language` - Language type hint to help format the glyphs correctly. This should be a abbreviation from the [Text TOP/SOP Unicode Language Abbreviations](https://docs.derivative.ca/Text_TOP/SOP_Unicode_Language_Abbreviations "Text TOP/SOP Unicode Language Abbreviations") table.
Reading Direction `readingdirection` - ⊞ - Use to set whether the language reads Left to Right or Right to Left.

Kerning `kerning` - ⊞ - The amount of space to add between letters in X and Y. Kerning is way of adding an arbitrary offset between letters. There already is a default offset associated with each font so the letters are flush against each other. The Kerning parameter this adds to that and allows for a Y offset.

* `kerning1` -

* `kerning2` -

Line Spacing `linespacing` - Determines the amount of space between lines of text.
Horizontal Align `alignx` - ⊞ - Sets the horizontal alignment.

* In Reading Direction `reading` -

Word Wrap Size `wordwrapsize` - Determines the amount of 3D space used before the line wraps.
Text `text` - The string of text to create as geometry. If newlines or tabs are desired, the recommended way is to change this parameter to expression mode, and specify a Python string that includes \n or \t to signify newlines and tabs. E.g `'First Line\nSecond Line'`.
Legacy Parsing `legacyparsing` - **Note, it's recommended to use a Python expression in the Text parameter instead of enabling legacy parsing, as this parsing can easily run into issues with more complex strings.** When enabled and if the Text parameter is in Constant Mode, \t and \n character sequences will be turned into tab and newline characters respectively. Otherwise the \t and \n sequences will be left as literal \ and t and \ and n.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These three fields move the geometry in the three axes.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - These three fields rotate the geometry in the three axes.

Scale `s` - ⊞ - These three fields scale the geometry in the three axes.

# Text TOP

The Text TOP displays text strings in an image. It allows for multiple fonts, sizes, colors, borders, character separation and line separation. The text can be displayed as bit maps, anti-aliased lines, or filled polygon characters. Any TrueType font can be rendered by the Text TOP. [Unicode](Unicode.html "Unicode") is supported. The new Scalable Display Method uses [Slug Library](Slug_Library.html "Slug Library") to render scalable, resolution independent text at the highest qulaity available in the Text TOP.

It can display simple text strings with embedded numeric values. It can also format lines of text and numbers in decimal or floating point format, reading the numbers from a CHOP, using special formatting characters.

It can also render text strings from a [Table DAT](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") via the Specification DAT parameter, where column headings are the parameter names that are to ve overidden when rendering a line of text for reach row of the table.

Any [TrueType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) or [OpenType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType) font that has been loaded into Windows can be rendered by the Text TOP. To import a new font into your Windows system, open the **Fonts** folder in the **Control Panel**, then drag and drop your  [font files](File_Types.html "File Types") in (`.ttf/.otf` file format). Fonts can also be specified as `.ttf/.otf` file paths in the Font File parameter.

You can render **Unicode** text by reading the text as a python string. See [Unicode](Unicode.html "Unicode").

**Tip:** You can use the [textTOP\_Class](TextTOP_Class.html "TextTOP Class").textWidth member to calculate the width of the text in the Text TOP.

Field Component `field` - Specifies a [Field Component](Field_COMP.html "Field COMP") to use as the source of the text. The font and style of the text displayed in the Field Component are set using the parameters in the Text TOP.
DAT `dat` - Specifies a DAT to use for the source of the text. Drag and Drop a DAT onto this field, or manually enter the DAT's path.
DAT Row `rowindex` - The row number (starting from 0) of the cell, if the DAT is a table.
DAT Col `colindex` - The column number of the cell, if the DAT is a table.
Specification DAT `specdat` - A Table DAT that allows you to specify and position text by pixel, with the lower left corner being at 0, 0. Column headers must include `position1` or `x`, `position2` or `y`, and `text`. A sample table can be:
```
x	y	text		
0	0	lower left text		
100	100	somewhere in the middle

Text `text` - A string of text. It optionally can be followed by a numeric value and another post-string, as set with Value and Post Text below. If newlines or tabs are desired, the recommended way is to change this parameter to expression mode, and specify a Python string that includes \n or \t to signify newlines and tabs. E.g 'First Line\nSecond Line'.
Legacy Parsing `legacyparsing` - In older builds the syntax \XXX (E.g \200 would be character 200), \t, \n as well as [] and {} (to position strings) was parsed in the string. This is now deprecated. For specifying characters codes, \t and \n [Python syntax should be used instead.](https://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/unicode.html). The 'Specification DAT' should be used to position strings instead of [], {}. This parameter can be enabled to turn back on this legacy parsing though. If this is enabled and you want to display the characters `\ [ ] { }`, you must precede them with a `\`.
Append Value `appendvalue` - Enables the Value field defined below. This value is inserted between the Text string and the Post Text string.
Value `valuetouse` - The numeric value to display.
Total Digits `totaldigits` - The total number of digits in the value displayed.
Decimal Digits `decimaldigits` - The number of digits displayed after the decimal place.
Post Text `posttext` - The text string appended after Text and Value (if present).
CHOP Value %-Replace `chopvaluereplace` - Allows portions of the strings to be replaced by CHOP values via a syntax similar to C-style printf()/sprintf(). More details of the syntax are provided in the next parameter, 'CHOP' .
CHOP `chop` - The CHOP containing all the values to insert in the Text strings. The Text TOP will repeat the Text string until all CHOP channels are displayed. They are displayed by using a special syntax in your Text string, defined as string starting with `%`, for example `%4d`:
> `%[flags][width][.precision][type]`

* `flags` (optional) - Alignment options.
  + - : left align (text is right aligned by default)
  + 0 : pad the left side with zeros
* `width` (optional) - Total number of digits in the number displayed.
* `precision` (optional) - Number of digits after the decimal place.
* `type` - Number format.
  + d : integer
  + f : float
  + g : double, exponential format is used only when the exponent of the value is less than ?4.

Drag and Drop a CHOP onto this field, or manually enter the CHOP's path.

[![TextTOPCHOPValue.jpg](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/a/ad/TextTOPCHOPValue.jpg)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TextTOPCHOPValue.jpg)

Word Wrap `wordwrap` - When checked text is automatically line wrapped so it doesn't extend outside the TOP's borders. When using Word Wrap and Auto-Size together, the text will first word-wrap based on the specified font size, then auto size the resulting block of text.
Smart Quote `smartquote` - Enables smart quotes which use a left (opening) quotation mark and a right (closing) quotation mark instead of straight quotes.

* Stroke `stroke` - Same as polygons but only an outline of the text is displayed.

* Bitmap `bitmap` - Uses bitmap images for the text. Bitmap fonts are better for very small font sizes where high precision is required.

* Scalable `scalable` - Uses [Slug Library](Slug_Library.html "Slug Library") to render high-quality, scalable, resolution independent text.

Anti-Alias `antialias` - ⊞ - Smoothes out the edges of the text. Not available for Texture Display Mode.

Stroke Width `strokewidth` - Controls the width of the outline when using Stroke Display Method.

* No Auto-Fit `nofit` - Does not use any auto-fitting. Font Size specified in Font Size X and Font Size Y parameters.

* Auto-Fit Always `alwaysfit` - The font size will be increased or decreased so the text fits across the Text TOP from edge to edge.

* Auto-Fit if Too Large `fitiffat` - Only auto sizes the text if the text is too large and spills past the edges of the Text TOP. In this case the font size will be decreased to fit it within the borders of the TOP.

Font Size X `fontsizex` - Sets the font size in X (horizontal). **Note:** Floating point font sizes are permissable when using *Polygon* and *Outline* Display Methods.
Font Size X Unit `fontsizexunit` - Select the units for this parameter from Pixels, Fraction, Fraction Aspect or Points (font point size). A Point is defined using the Windows conventions for 100% scaling, which is 96 pixels to 72 points. That is, a point size of 10 is the same as a pixel size of 10\*(96/72) = 13.333.
Font Size Y `fontsizey` - Sets the font size in Y (vertical). **Note:** Floating point font sizes are permissable when using *Polygon* and *Outline* Display Methods.
Font Size Y Unit `fontsizeyunit` - Select the units for this parameter from Pixels, Fraction, Fraction Aspect or Points (font point size).
Keep Font Ratio `keepfontratio` - Ignores Y value in Font Size. Sets both X and Y size to Font Size X.
Break Language `breaklang` - Language type hint to help format the glyphs correctly.
Reading Direction `readingdirection` - ⊞ - Use to set whether the language reads Left to Right or Right to Left.

Tracking `tracking` - ⊞ - The amount of space to add between letters in X and Y. Tracking is way of adding an arbitrary offset between letters. There already is a default offset associated with each font so the letters are flush against each other. The Tracking parameter this adds to that and allows for a Y offset.

## Fixing Seams & Unrolling Geometry

**NOTE:** the following discussing pertains only to face and hull primitives.

If a texture type requires fixing of seams and the texture is applied to vertices, the wrapped primitives are unrolled before computing the texture coordinates. Unrolling a wrapped primitive turns it into an open primitive whose new vertices use the same points as the vertices they have been uniqued from. Thus, unrolling does not change the point count, nor does it allow cracks to appear further down the road. Explicit unrolling, using the [Primitive SOP](Primitive_SOP.html "Primitive SOP"), is not required.

The seam fixing is done after computing the texture coordinates. It is required whether textures are applied to vertices or points, and it's done in u, v, or both.

The following texture types require fixing of seams:

* Cylindrical - seams fixed in u.
* Polar - seams fixed in u and v.
* Row/col - seams fixed in u and v.
* Spline types: Uniform, Chord Length, and Average - seams fixed in u and v.

**Note:** When the projection type is **Cylindrical** or **Polar**, closed meshes, Bzier & NURBS surfaces will be opened. At least one row/column of vertices will be added (possibly more for NURBS<). This is to prevent poor interpolation of texture coordinates at the seam of the join.

Primitive Group `group` - If there are input primitive groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Does not work with point or vertex groups. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").

## Parameters - Texture Page

Texture Layer `texlayer` - If the geometry has multiple textures layers applied to it, this parameter determines which layer of UV coordinates this Texture SOP will effect.
Texture Type `type` - ⊞ - The Face, Uniform Spline, and Arc-Length Spline texturing methods accept spline curves as well as polygons.

When using one of the spline-based methods, specifying a paste hierarchy in the Group field will propagate the computation of texture coordinates to all of its nodes. Projection methods will typically yield smoother texture continuity between pasted surfaces than any of the spline methods. Sometimes it helps ensuring that pasted features are Chord-length parameterized with the [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html "Basis SOP").

* Orthographic `texture` - Direct projection from Projection Axis.

* XYZ Position `xyzposition` - The XYZ position of the vertices will be copied into the UVW values.

* Equirectangular Inside (Spherical Polar) `equirectangularin` - Applies corrdinates to properly apply an equirectangular texture map to the inside of an object. Useful for skyboxes for example.

* Equirectangular Outside (Spherical Polar) `equirectangularout` - Applies corrdinates to properly apply an equirectangular texture map to the outside of an object.

* Cylindrical `cylin` - Wrap cylindrically in Projection Axis direction.

* Row & Columns `rowcol` - For geometry constructed as a mesh (Grid, Sphere, Tube, Skin, and Sweep). The U coordinates are placed along rows, and the V coordinates along columns. This is good for texturing curved meshes such as car fenders where you cannot project from any one axis.

* Face `face` - Maps a copy of the texture onto every face. You should make points unique using a [Facet SOP](Facet_SOP.html "Facet SOP"), before using this function in the Texture SOP. The map is graphically projected to each face along its normal, so the texture is oriented properly for each face. However, the map is not scaled to fit each polygon, nor is it distorted by the shape of each polygon. If the geometry changes in size in object space, the texture does not "stick" to the geometry. It is best suited to texturing objects that represent chunks of rock and brick, as the textures will likely not match at the edges between polygons.

* Modify Source `modify` - If the Source already has texture UV coordinates, they are maintained. You can offset and scale them, however, using Scale and Offset.

* Uniform Spline `suniform` - This projection type operates only on NURBS and Bzier surfaces. It samples the domain space (i.e. the basis) of each surface uniformly in U and V and assigns those (u,v) values as texture coordinates to the surface points or vertices. To ensure continuity between the texture space of adjacent surfaces insert a [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html "Basis SOP") before the Texture SOP and toggle Concatenate on to merge the spline bases in U and/or V.

* Average Spline `saverage` - Stores the average of degree successive knots into the texture attribute. These averages are known as **Greville points**. This method and Uniform Spline are recommended for pasted surfaces.

* Arc Length Spline `sarclen` - This method is similar to the Uniform Spline method since it relies on the underlying spline basis when computing the texture coordinates. Both methods generate texture coordinates in the same range, bounded by the minimum and maximum knot values. The difference between the two spline methods lies in the spacing between successive texture coordinates. The uniform method samples the parameter space uniformly. The Arc-Length Spline method chooses the texture coordinates based on surface arc-lengths.

Since the Uniform Spline method relies heavily on the parametric fabric of the surface, the resulting texture will tend to squash and stretch given uneven surface parameterizations. The Arc-Length Spline method reduces this effect by relating the texture space directly to the world space of the surface, while ensuring that the size and origin of the generated texture space coincide with those of the underlying domain.

* Edge Length `edgelength` - Applies to hulls + faces (NURBs/Bezier/Polygon).

* Perspective From Camera `persp` - The texture coordinates are assigned so that the world space of the object can be textured to fit the projection of the camera exactly. If any points are behind the near clipping plane or beyond the far clipping plane, the texture coordinates (`0, 0, 0`) are assigned. Note: Unless a Custom Projection matrix is used in the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP"), the aspect ratio of the projection is assumed to be 1:1. You may need to scale the UVs to match the aspect ratio of your render.

* Equidistant Azimuth (Fish Eye 180) `equiazimuth` - Applies coordinates for using 180 degree Fish Eye maps.

* Equidistant Azimuth (Fish Eye 360) `equiazimuth360` - Applies coordinates for using 360 degree Fish Eye maps.

Projection Axis `axis` - ⊞ - Axis to project along, or projection method from splines. X, Y, or Z axes.

Camera Name `camera` - This is used when the Perspective From Camera Texture Type is selected. The menu is used to select which light or camera to project the perspective coordinates from.
Apply to `coord` - ⊞ - Select to apply texture coordinates to their Natural Location, Point textures, or Vertex textures.

When Natural location is selected, the UV's will be applied to the verticies when using Polar, Cylindrical, Rows and Columns, and Face texture types. Orthographic, Uniform Spline, Average Spline and Arc Length Spline will always generate point UV's when you choose Natural.

Natural Location will also create vertex uvs when creating new texture layers, if a vertex uv already exists for layer 0.

IIf the primitive is open in both directions like a grid or a surface (so that the ends do not touch), then the advantage of vertex UV's does not apply since there are no matched seams on the single surface to worry about.

Using vertex UVs gives you unique points at the closed seam whereas point UVs are shared at seams and are, by default given a value of 0 for either U or V depending on the closed direction of the surface. If you want to make a closed surface open, simply insert a [Carve SOP](Carve_SOP.html "Carve SOP") in the chain and place a single carve in the surface of the direction that the surface is closed.

* Natural location `natural` -

* Point texture `point` -

* Vertex texture (fix seams) `vertex` -

Scale `s` - ⊞ - Scales the texture coordinates a specific amount.

* `su` -

* `sv` -

* `sw` -

Offset `offset` - ⊞ - Offsets the texture coordinates a specific amount.

* `offsetu` -

* `offsetv` -

* `offsetw` -

Rotate `angle` - Rotates the texture coordinates the specified value.

**Tip:** Before applying a spline-based texture projection with the Texture SOP, remap the U and/or V bases of the spline surface (using a [Basis SOP](Basis_SOP.html "Basis SOP")) between 0 and 1 to ensure a complete mapping of the texture. If a single texture map must be shared by several surfaces, the surface bases should be concatenated prior to being remapped.

Fix Face Seams `fixseams` - Attempts to correct texture continuity at face seams.

Add further transformations to the texture coordinate space.

Translate `t` - ⊞ - These three fields move the texture coordinates in the three axes.

Rotate `r` - ⊞ - These three fields rotate the texture coordinates in the three axes.

Scale `scaletwo` - ⊞ - These three fields scale the texture coordinates in the three axes.

* X `scaletwox` -

* Y `scaletwoy` -

* Z `scaletwoz` -

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - The pivot point for the transformations (not the same as the pivot point in the pivot channels). The pivot point parameters allow you to define the point about which the texture coordinates scale and rotate. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed.

For example, during a scaling operation, if the pivot point of the texture coordinates is located at: `-1, -1, 0` and you wanted to scale by `0.5` (reduce its size by 50%) the texture would scale toward the pivot point and appear to slide down and to the left.

In the example above, rotations performed on a texture coordinates with different pivot points produce very different results.

Time COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Time COMP

The Time Component allows each component to have its own timeline (clock). The Time Component contains a network of operators that can drive a [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline"), drive animations in [Animation COMPs](Animation_COMP.html "Animation COMP"), or be used to drive any custom time-based system. The Time Component's parameters define the speed, range, various options for the time system.

The Time Component is often used in TouchDesigner to allow a component to have its own timeline / clock, this is called [Component Time](Component_Time.html "Component Time"). It is useful for holding some parts of your system stationary while others are allowed to play forward. A Time Component's location must be in the `/local` network of a [Component](Component.html "Component") for the Time Component to create a **Component Time**.

To add Component Time to a component, right-click on the component and select **Add Component Time...** from the popup menu, this will add the following Time Component `/comppath/local/time`.

The Time Component's predefined network is [Cloned](Clone.html "Clone") from Master Component `/sys/local/time`. The Time Component's network can be modified if the path in the Clone parameter is removed.

Time Machine TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Time Machine TOP

The Time Machine TOP combines pixels in a sequence of images stored in a [Texture 3D TOP](Texture_3D_TOP.html "Texture 3D TOP"). Whereas "morphing" warps an image "spatially" (in xy), Time Machine warps images only in time.

Time Machine, originally known as "tima" in PRISMS, was first used in 1995 for warping effects in Ghost in the Shell, a Japanese anime cyber film that heavily used PRISMS for camera perspective effects, compositing, 3D and effects.

You must connect a Texture 3D TOP to the Time Machine's first input. It uses this array of images and displays different depths of the 3D texture.

The second input determines the time offset of the output image. The second input is expected to be monochrome, but uses the red channel when it is not monochrome. By default, where there is a black pixel in the second input, it gets the oldest layer of the 3D texture. Where there is a white pixel in the second input, it gets the most recent layer of the 3D texture. Black Offset and White Offset adjust the range of time that the black to white parts of the image are offset within. For example, if Black Offset is -10 and White Offset is 0, then a black pixel would be 10 frames behind in time, a white pixel the current frame, and a 50% grey pixel would be 5 frames behind in time (in between the Black and White Offsets).

Time Slice CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Time Slice CHOP

The Time Slice CHOP outputs a time slice of samples. It is used to generate smooth in-betweens when TouchDesigner cannot cook/draw fast enough and keep up with the animation's frames per second. When you send it to a [Record CHOP](Record_CHOP.html "Record CHOP") or [Gesture CHOP](Gesture_CHOP.html "Gesture CHOP"), you will see the channels recorded and playing back more smoothly.

The number and names of channels does not change between input and output, but the output's frame range is a time slice: it goes from the previous frame that TouchDesigner cooked plus one, to the current frame.

For example, assume the TouchDesigner frames per second is four frames to remain realtime. Say the input to the Time Slice CHOP is a slider which only gets sampled when TouchDesigner draws. We will have slider values for frames 231 and 235, but there are no slider values for frames 232, 233 and 234, the current frame is 235, and the previous frame that TouchDesigner cooked and drew was frame 231. It had to skip.

When the Method is set to Linear in this example, the Time Slice CHOP will output a "time slice" which is a 4-sample CHOP for frames 232 to 235, and the values at frames 232 to 234 will be the values interpolated between the slider at frames 231 and 235.

Therefore any CHOPs after the Time Slice CHOP, like Gesture, Record or [Lag CHOP](Lag_CHOP.html "Lag CHOP") will get smooth data going into it, even though TouchDesigner isn't cooking every frame.

Timecode CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Timecode CHOP

The Timecode CHOP generates [Timecode](Timecode.html "Timecode") data (channels, a `.timecode` python object and other python members). Its Mode menu provides a variety of ways to get, set and generate timecode through its parameters, including being driven from a timecode string, a set of channels, or other OPs that have timecode such as video input devices. You can also set timecode with python functions.

The timecode data is output as both channel data in the CHOP, and as a [Timecode object](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") via its [`.timecode` member](https://docs.derivative.ca/TimecodeCHOP_Class#timecode "TimecodeCHOP Class") in Python.

The timecode can follow the SMPTE standard (ie. non-negative, frames-per-second up to 60, loops at 24 hours), or a more general format (ie. any number of frames per second, negative timecode allowed, loops at 100 hours).

When being driven by channels, an input with channels named `negative`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`, or `frame` can be provided that is added to the Timecode CHOP's output.

See also: [Timecode](Timecode.html "Timecode"), [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") and the OP Snippets for the Timecode CHOP.

## Parameters - Timecode Page

SMPTE `smpte` - When enabled the generated timecode will follow the [SMPTE timecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_timecode) standard, meaning no negative timecodes, and the timecode will loop at 24 hours. When disabled, the format will be more general, allowing for negative numbers and a maximum timecode of 100 hours.

* Off `off` - Drop-frames will not added.

* Automatic `auto` - Drop-frames will be added to the timecode when the rate is fractional. For special rate values such as 29.97, the defined standard solution is used (ie. 2 frames added every minute, except minutes that are divisible by 10).

Custom Length `customlength` - When enabled, a custom length can be specified for the timecode. If not, the default length will be 23:59:59:ff-1 for a SMPTE timecode and 99:59:59:ff-1 otherwise.
Length `length` - Specifies the custom length in either samples, frames, or seconds. If it is desired to reference a Timecode Object then either `tdu.Timecode().totalSeconds` or `tdu.Timecode().totalFrames`, depending on the unit value.
Length Units `lengthunits` - ⊞ - The unit of the custom length.

Cycle `cycle` - When enabled, the timecode value will cycle back to `00:00:00:00` upon reaching the custom length, rather than holding the last value.

Negative Chan `negativechan` - When enabled, outputs the negative channel, which is true when the timecode is negative. Always false when using SMPTE standard.
Frame Chan `framechan` - When enabled, outputs the frame channel.

# Timeline CHOP

The Timeline CHOP outputs time-based CHOP channels for a specific component. The time channels are defined by a [Time Component](Time_COMP.html "Time COMP") whose [Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") can be determined using the python expression `me.time`. When a **Reference Node** is specified, the time defined at that node is used. When the Reference Node is not specified, then the time defined at the Timeline CHOP's location is used (ie. time defined at `me.time`).

Timer CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Timer CHOP

The Timer CHOP is an engine for running timed processes. It outputs channels such as timing fractions, counters, pulses and timer states, and it calls python functions (callbacks) when various timing events occur.

Examples using the Timer CHOP include triggering multiple timed cues, running playlists, timelines, state machines, and driving pre-animated animation components in 3D scenes. See Help -> Operator Snippets for numerous examples.

You set a timer to a number of seconds (or unlimited), frames or samples, and trigger it to start via the Start parameter or the second input CHOP. The Timer CHOP outputs in seconds, frames, samples, fraction and on-off states as it’s counting, including a `done` channel that goes on when it is complete. When it reaches certain states like end-of-cycles or when it’s done, various python callbacks are called allowing you to customize its behavior.

The Timer CHOP gets triggered by events (via pulsing its parameters or driving its two inputs). It takes events in, counts time, changes state. Via its python callback functions, you can send events out to other nodes, set parameters, get/set values in DATs, CHOPs and storage, restart itself, or trigger other nodes. As such, it can operate as a state machine.

It has play/pause, plus a speed control to slow down or speed up the timer.

It can also cycle indefinitely and then can be signaled to end immediately or at the end of the current cycle.

**Recommended**: the **OP Snippets for Timer CHOP**. See the channel descriptions in [Initialize Start](Initialize_Start.html "Initialize Start").

**Multiple Timer segments** - One Timer CHOP can also have multiple timers within it. By attaching a Table DAT you can define one timer (segment) per row. In Serial Timers mode it allows for one time segment followed by another. In Parallel Timers mode, the timers all run in parallel, each with its own begin time and length, and its own set of output channels.

[![Timer CHOP.2.png](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/8/82/Timer_CHOP.2.png)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:Timer_CHOP.2.png)

The Timer CHOP can be Locked to Timeline in a deterministic way, or run more freely in Sequential Mode. When run independently from the timeline, you can jump ahead, break out of cycles, pause, `goTo()` exact position or timecode in the timer, and dynamically adjust the speed.

Attach an Info DAT to the Timer CHOP to see the timecodes, or use the `.timecode` members. Custom text strings can be placed in the Info DAT for each segment, and custom animated channels can be created.

To make an entire Timer CHOP loop after the last segment, set the On Done menu to Re-Start.

**Tip: What happens when you press Start** - The timers are at 0 when you initialize, for example timer\_frames = 0. On the frame when you press Start, by default, the running channel goes from 0 to 1, all the timer counter channels step forward by 1 frame. If you want the timers to hold at 0 until the next frame, set the Delay parameter to 1 frame. This is useful when you are cutting from black to a visible first-frame of a movie. If the length of the timer is 100 frames, it will make the running channel on for 100 frames, otherwise it will be 99 (though subsequent cycles are always 100).

**Chaining Timers** - The Timer CHOPs can be chained together, so that when one ends, the next can begin. They just need to all be Initialized together, where the `ready_pulse` channel of one Timer CHOP is exported to the Initialize parameter of the next Timer CHOP. Then they can be run in sequence, where the output of one Timer CHOP’s `done_pulse` channel is wired to the Start input (or exported to the Start parameter) of the next Timer CHOP. You start the chain of timers by starting the first Timer CHOP. By using some Timer CHOPs to loop awaiting input or response, or by adding logic to decide which CHOP to start next, state machines can be implemented.

### Callbacks

The callbacks are called at different moments during the timer progression.

`onInitialize()` gets called when you pulse the Initialize parameter. Here you can prepare any part of your setup prior to starting. At the end of Initialize the timer goes into a "ready" state.

`onStart()` gets called on the frame that the Start parameter is pulsed. The timer then goes into a "running" state.

`onTimerActive()` gets called every frame that the timer is running and there is no Delay or Play is off.

`onCycleStart()` gets called if the timer is set to cycle via the Cycle parameters.

Before a cycle or segment ends, an `onCycleEndAlert()` callback based on the Cycle End Alert parameter can be called to allow you to prepare for the next cycle, segment or Timer CHOP.

`onSegmentEnter()` and `onSegmentExit()` get called if the timer is being driven by a Segments DAT which acts like several timers in one. The argument `segment` in these callbacks is actually an object with useful members including any custom columns you have in your segment table: In `onSegmentEnter()`, put the code `print(help(segment))`

`onDone()` gets called when the timer reaches its finished state.

You can initialize at a specific time by using `.masterSeconds` in `onInitialize()`.

## Parameters - Segments Page

You can specify multiple timers in one Timer CHOP. A "segment" acts as one timer, with its own length, delay time, number of cycles to repeat and other conditions.

Segments DAT `segdat` - A table DAT that contains one row per timer (segment). The column headings can be `delay` or `begin`, `length`, `cycle`, `cyclelimit`, `maxcycles` and `cycleendalert`, which override the equivalent parameters. (These are the internal names for the corresponding parameters.) `begin` is unique as it replaces `delay`, and it represents the time from Start that the timer will begin counting, whether the CHOP is set to Serial Timers or Parallel Timers (see Segment Method).

The Segments DAT also can include any number of custom columns. See Columns to Custom Channels and Columns to Info DAT below.

Segment Method `segmethod` - ⊞ - If the Segment Method is **Serial Timers**, the timers will be played back-to-back. If the Segment Method is **Parallel Timers**, the timers can be played at the same time, and a set of channels will be output for each timer.

* Serial Timers `serial` -

* Parallel Timers `parallel` -

Segment Units `segunits` - ⊞ - For the columns `delay`, `begin`, `length` and `cycleendalert`, you specify whether it’s seconds, frames or samples with this menu.

Segments End Time `segsendtime` - ⊞ - Describes how the end time is calculated.

* From Segments DAT `dat` - The end time is based on the Segments DAT values.

* From Length Parameter `par` - The end time is based on the Length parameter value.

* Max of Parameter/Table `max` - The end time is based on the greater of the Length parameter value and the Segments DAT values.

Columns to Custom Channels `channelcolumns` - Optional extra columns (any name) in the segments DAT can be output as extra channels (the columns must contain numbers). Specify their names in the Columns to Channels parameter. The channel name will be the column name. You can also output the `length`, `delay`, etc columns as channels.
Custom Channel Interpolation `interpolation` - ⊞ - By default, custom channels step to their new value at the begin of the segment. This menu lets you interpolate to the new value linearly, or any combination of ease-in and ease-out.

* Step to Value `steptovalue` -

* Linear to Value `lineartovalue` -

* Ease In to Value `easeintovalue` -

* Ease Out to Value `easeouttovalue` -

* Ease In-Out to Value `easeinouttovalue` -

Columns to Info DAT `infocolumns` - Optional extra columns (any name) in the segments DAT can be output to the Info DAT (attach an Info DAT to the Timer CHOP) if you specify their names in this parameter.
Go to Previous Segment `gotoprevseg` - (pulse) Jump to Previous Segment.
Go to Next Segment `gotonextseg` - (pulse) Jump to Next Segment.

*Lingo*

* Segment – each segment acts as one timer, with delay time, length, number of cycles to repeat and other conditions.
* Begin – in Parallel Timers, the number of seconds after a Start (frames or samples) after which each timer starts counting up from zero.
* Done – The state it goes into when all the timers has finished counting, whether they are in Parallel or Serial, Segments or not.
* End – Cycle End is the end of each cycle, Segment End is the end of the segment.
* Cumulative Time – Zero at Start, a count that is affected by speed and rises while timers are active (not during delays).
* Running Time – Zero at Start, the wall-clock time since Start was called no matter what are the delays, speeds, cycles or premature clicking of Go To Segment End. It stops counting when Done has been reached.

## Parameters - Sub Range Page

Operate the timer within a sub range of the total length.

Sub Range `subrange` - Turn this parameter on to limit the timer output to a subrange of the full length.
Sub Start `substart` - The beginning point of the sub range.
Sub Start Units `substartunits` - ⊞ - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.

Sub End `subend` - The end point of the sub range.
Sub End Units `subendunits` - ⊞ - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.

Sub End Action `subendaction` - ⊞ - Controls the behavior once the sub range end point is reached: Loop at End, or Pause at End.

* Pause at End `pause` -

* Loop at End `loop` -

Timer Fraction `outfraction` - Outputs channel `timer_fraction` for each segment.
Timer Count `outtimercount` - ⊞ - Outputs the elapsed Seconds channel as `timer_seconds`, Frames outputs channel as `timer_frames`, or Samples outputs channel as `timer_samples`. Because this is elapsed time, `timer_frames` starts at 0, as do the others.

Timer Active `outtimeractive` - Outputs channel `timer_active` which is on only while the timer fraction is counting (is non-zero).
Timer Pulse `outtimerpulse` - Outputs channel `timer_pulse` when the timer reaches its length.
Delay Fraction `outdelayfraction` - Outputs a 0-1 fraction in `delay_fraction` while the delay occurs.
Delay Count `outdelaycount` - ⊞ - Outputs the delay count in seconds, frames or samples.

Initializing `outinit` - Outputs channel `initializing` = 1 while the timer is initalizing (i.e. while the callback `onInitialize()` returns non-zero).
Ready `outready` - Outputs channel `ready` which is 1 after an Initialize and before a Start.
Ready Pulse `outreadypulse` - Outputs a pulse when initialization has finished and the timer is ready to start. It pulses even when the timer starts rights away after an initialization.
Running `outrunning` - Outputs channel `running` which is 1 after a Start and before the Done.
Done `outdone` - Outputs channel `done` when done or complete.
Done Pulse `outdonepulse` - Outputs channel `done` when the all timers have reached their completion.
Cycles `outcycle` - Outputs channel `cycles`, which is the number of cycles completed (In a segment), starting with 0 during the entire first cycle. If you jump to Done, cycle is incremented as if it played normally to the done state.
Cycle Pulse `outcyclepulse` - Outputs a pulse at the end of every cycle, even on the first and only cycle.
Cycles + Fraction `outcycleplusfraction` - Outputs channel `cycle_plus_fraction`, starting with 0 for entire first cycle.
Segment `outseg` - Outputs channel `segment`, starting with 0 for first segment.
Segment Pulse `outsegpulse` - Outputs channel `segment_pulse` which is a pulse at the end of each segment.
Segment + Fraction `outsegplusfraction` - Outputs channel `segment_plus_fraction`, starting with 0 for first segment ending at #segments at end.
Length `outlength` - ⊞ - Outputs channel `length`, starting with 0 for first segment ending at #segments at end.

Cumulative Timer Count `outcumulativecount` - ⊞ - Outputs `cumulative_seconds`, `cumulative_frames` or `cumulative_samples`. It is a time count that adds up all the Timer Active times for all segments since Start: it is affected by "Speed", and counts up only while `timer_active` (Play) is on. See the python member `.cumulativeSeconds`.

Playing Timer Count `outplayingcount` - ⊞ - Outputs `playing_seconds`, `playing_frames` or `playing_samples`. It is a time count that adds up all the Timer Active times for all segments since Start: it is not affected by "Speed", and counts up only while `timer_active` and `play` is on. See the python member `.playingSeconds`.

Running Time Count `outrunningcount` - ⊞ - Outputs the "wall-clock" time since Start occurred, no matter what are the delays, speeds, cycles or pre-mature clicking of Go To Segment End, etc. It stops counting when Done has been reached. `running_seconds`, `running_frames`, or `running_samples`. When CHOP is set to Parallel Timers, this will output a channel per segment plus one global running time channel. See the python member `.runningSeconds`.

Master Time Count `outmastercount` - ⊞ - Outputs `master_seconds`, `master_frames` or `master_samples`. It is a time count that adds up all the Timer Active times for all segments since Start: it is affected by "Speed", and counts up only while `timer_active` and `play` is on. It also includes any delay times. See the python member `.masterSeconds`.

timerCHOP Class - Derivative

# timerCHOP Class

This class inherits from the  [CHOP class](CHOP_Class.html "CHOP Class").
It references a specific [Timer CHOP](Timer_CHOP.html "Timer CHOP").

Setting the current time in the Timer CHOP: The member `.masterSeconds` is the main clock in the Timer CHOP and can it can be set directly using python (`OP.masterSeconds = val`), or alternately you can use the `.goTo()` function which has more options. Both have the same effect, and you can also use `.masterFraction`, `.masterFrames` and `.masterSamples`.

`beginFrame` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Get a list of begin values in frames. 0-based.

`beginSample` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Get a list of begin values in samples. 0-based.

`beginSeconds` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> Get a list of begin values in seconds.

`cumulativeFrames` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the cumulative time expressed in frames. See `.cumulativeSeconds`.

`cumulativeSamples` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the cumulative time expressed in samples. See `.cumulativeSeconds`.

`cumulativeSeconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the cumulative time expressed in seconds. It counts from 0 when you Start. Unlike `.runningSeconds`, it is slowed/sped by the Speed parameter, and paused by the Play parameter. It continues to increase if there is any looping, jumping or scrubbing around.

`cumulativeTimecode` → `tdu.Timecode` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the cumulative time as a Timecode Object. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class"). See `.cumulativeSeconds`.

`masterFrames` → `int` :

> Get or set the master time expressed in frames. 0-based. See `.masterSeconds`.

`masterSamples` → `int` :

> Get or set the master time expressed in samples. See `.masterSeconds`.

`masterSeconds` → `float` :

> Get or set the master time expressed in seconds. It counts from 0 when you Start, `.masterSeconds` is slowed/sped by the Speed parameter, and paused by the Play parameter. It jumps to the appropriate time when you scrub. This is the main clock in the Timer CHOP and can be set directly using python (`OP.masterSeconds = val`), or use the `.goTo()` function which has more options. When multi-segments are specified to the Timer CHOP, it reflects the time as if you ran through the segments without interrupting it. If in any segment Cycle is on and Cycle Limit is off, it calculates as if the cycle runs only once.

`masterFraction` → `float` :

> Get or set the master time expressed in fractional form. See `.masterSeconds`.

`masterTimecode` → `tdu.Timecode` :

> Get or set the master time expressed as a Timecode Object. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class"). See `.masterSeconds`.

`cycle` → `float` :

> Get or set the cycle index of the current segment.

`fraction` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the time index in fractional form, same as the `timer_fraction` channel. Used in the callbacks, it's more up-to-date to the current frame. (When using segments, it's the first segment).

`playingFrames` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the playing time expressed in frames. 0-based. See `.playingSeconds`.

`playingSamples` → `int` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the playing time expressed in samples. See `.playingSeconds`.

`playingSeconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the playing time expressed in seconds. It counts from 0 when you Start. it is unaffected by the Speed parameter, but unlike `.runningSeconds`, it is paused by the Play parameter. It continues to increase if there is any looping, jumping or scrubbing around.

`playingTimecode` → `tdu.Timecode` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the playing time as a Timecode Object. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class"). See `.playingSeconds`.

`runningFraction` → `float` :

> Get the running time index expressed in fractional form. See `.runningSeconds`. This will be an estimate as the actual length is approximated on start.

`runningFrames` → `float` :

> Get the running time expressed in frames. 0-based. See `.runningSeconds`.

`runningSamples` → `float` :

> Get the running time index expressed in samples. See `.runningSeconds`.

`runningSeconds` → `float` :

> Get the running time expressed in seconds. It keeps counting up after Start and is not affected by changing the Speed or pausing Play or scrubbing. It is basically the "wall clock" after pressing Start. (You normally don't set the value, use `.masterSeconds`.) It doesn't reset to 0 until you Initialize or Start again.

`runningTimecode` → `tdu.Timecode` :

> Get the running time index as a Timecode Object. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class"). See `.runningSeconds`.

`runningLengthFrames` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the running length expressed in frames.

`runningLengthSamples` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the running length expressed in samples.

`runningLengthSeconds` → `float` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the running length expressed in seconds.

`runningLengthTimecode` → `tdu.Timecode` **(Read Only)**:

> Get the running length as a Timecode Object. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class").

`segment` → `float` :

> Get or set the segment index.

> Get the list of segments.

> Get the master timecode. See [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class").

`goToNextSegment()`→ `None`:

> Jump to the next segment. Equivalent to pulsing the Go to Next Segment parameter on the Segments Page.

`goToCycleEnd()`→ `None`:

> Jump to the end of the current cycle. Equivalent to pulsing the Go to End of Cycle parameter on the Timer Page.

`goTo(segment=0, cycle=0, endOfCycle=True, seconds=0, frame=0, sample=0, fraction=0)`→ `None`:

> Allows the user to jump to a different time index based on the arguments passed in. Only one unit of time (seconds, frame, sample, fraction) can be specified when calling this method. For example, including both seconds and frame will yield an error. If there are multiple segments, and only a unit of time is specified, the method will jump to the corresponding running time index. If either a segment index or a cycle index or both are specified along with a unit of time, the method will jump to the corresponding local time index. There are fifteen different combinations of arguments that the user can pass in. An example of how this method can be called is: timerop.goTo(segment=1, cycle=2, seconds=5, endOfCycle=True).
> 
> * segment - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated segment number (0 is first).
> * cycle - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated cycle number (0 is first).
> * endOfCycle - (Keyword, Optional) False by default. If specified as True, the goTo() function with the specified arguments will be called again at the end of the cycle, causing a jump only at that time to the specified location.
> * seconds - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated time index. Cannot also specify frame, sample, or fraction.
> * frame - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated time index. Cannot also specify seconds, sample, or fraction.
> * sample - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated time index. Cannot also specify seconds, frame, or fraction.
> * fraction - (Keyword, Optional) If specified, will jump to the indicated time index. Cannot also specify seconds, frame, or sample.

`goToPrevSegment()`→ `None`:

> Jump to the previous segment. Equivalent to pulsing the Go to Previous Segment parameter on the Segments Page.

`lastCycle()`→ `None`:

> Sets the current cycle to be the last cycle of the current segment. Equivalent to pulsing the Exit at End of Cycle parameter on the Timer Page.

Note that `onTimerPulse()` is called when the timer starts counting up, and `onSegmentEnter()` is called when the segment starts, which is when the delay (if any) starts.

Note that the `onInitialize()` return values let you initialize asyncrounously over several frames until you are ready to Start.

# TOP

[![OP TOP.png](images/a/a9/OP_TOP.png)](File_OP_TOP.html)

See also [Category:TOPs](Category_TOPs.html "Category:TOPs") for a full list of articles related to TOPs.

**Texture Operators**, also known as **TOPs**, are image operators that provide real-time, GPU-based compositing and image manipulation. All calculations for TOPs are performed on the system's GPU. TOPs can be used for preparing textures, compositing streams images and movies, building control panel elements, manipulation of 32-bit floating point data, and almost any other image task you might have. TOPs support many formats, including floating-point image formats for working with high-dynamic range (HDR) images.

All renders and composites occur offscreen with TOPs. Data can be scaled to any resolution, limited only by the amount of graphics RAM and the maximum resolution of the graphics card.

TOPs that are being used to hold point cloud data, where R G B holds 32-bit X Y Z data can be viewed as a 3D set of points by right-clicking on the viewer and selecting View as Points.

**NOTE:** TouchDesigner Non-Commercial is limited to 1280x1280 resolution.

TOP to CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# TOP to CHOP

The TOP to CHOP converts pixels in a [TOP](TOP.html "TOP") image to [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") channels. Each pixel color element (RGBA) is placed in a separate channel. Depending on the parameter options, the node will either create a single set of channels for the whole image or it can create a separate set of channels for each scanline (row).

A single pixel, rows of pixels, columns of pixels or rectangular regions can be extracted from the image. It is therefore important to be aware of how many pixels your source image is composed of.

The Exclude NaN and Active Mask parameters can be used to skip certain pixels so they are not included in the chop channels.

There is an optional input which supplies UV coordinates to sample the image. The input CHOP must contain 2 channels, for U and V. The first channel is always assumed to be U. The channels produced (red, green, blue and alpha) will be exactly as long as the input channel's length, with a value for each UV coordinate.

If you are grabbing pixels from a [Depth TOP](Depth_TOP.html "Depth TOP"), you will only get a single channel (the depth). This will be placed in the R channel.

TOP `top` - Specify the TOP operator whose image will be sampled.
Download Type `downloadtype` - ⊞ - Gives the option for a delayed data download from the GPU, which is much faster and does not stall the render.

Red `r` - The prefix for channels created from the red pixels of the source image. If multiple red channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the vertical scanline number of the image e.g. `r0` - `r4`.
Green `g` - The prefix for channels created from the green pixels of the source image. If multiple green channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. `g0` - `g4`.
Blue `b` - The prefix for channels created from the blue pixels of the source image. If multiple blue channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. `b0` - `b4`.
Alpha `a` - The prefix for channels created from the alpha pixels of the source image. If multiple alpha channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. `a0` - `a4`.
Output as Single Channel Set `singleset` - Controls whether a channel is created for each scanline, or whether all scanlines are appended into a single channel set. A channel set refers to one CHOP channel per color channel of the source image e.g. 4 channels for an RGBA image.
Exclude NaNs `excludenans` - When enabled, pixels that have a NaN value in any of their channels will be skipped and not added to the CHOP channel.
Active Channel `activechannel` - ⊞ - When enabled, only pixels that have a non-zero value in the selected active channel will be added to the CHOP channel.

RGBA Units `rgbaunit` - ⊞ - Scales the output to lie in the range 0-1, 0-255 or 0-65535.

* 0 to 1 `norm` -

* Pixels `pixel` -

U Start `ustart` - Starting point for sampling in U. Values outside the range of the image are determined by the image's extend conditions, in the extend page.
U End `uend` - Ending point for sampling in U.
V Start `vstart` - Starting point for sampling in V.
V End `vend` - Ending point for sampling in V.
Interpolate `interp` - ⊞ - Determines the interpolation method when UV sampling with an input CHOP.

* Nearest Sample `nearest` -

Image Left `imageleft` - ⊞ - The image extend conditions when sampling the image with U less than 0.

Touch In CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Touch In CHOP

The Touch In CHOP can be used to create a high speed connection between two TouchDesigner processes via CHOPs.

Data is sent over TCP/IP. The Touch In CHOP (client) receives its data from a [Touch Out CHOP](Touch_Out_CHOP.html "Touch Out CHOP") (server). The Touch In CHOP is similar to a [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP") but highly optimized for TouchDesigner-to-TouchDesigner communication. For interfacing with other software or devices, see the [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP") or the [TCP/IP DAT](TCP/IP_DAT.html "TCP/IP DAT").

To receive network data from another "server" computer (e.g. from a Touch Out CHOP running remotely), a connection must be established between the server and the Touch In CHOP before data is sent.

The data is received as time slices, and can be used to eliminate frame dropping if the sender or receiver is not running at its target frame rate. See [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") and the [Time Slice CHOP](Time_Slice_CHOP.html "Time Slice CHOP").

To analyze the timing of the messages coming in, attach an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") to the Touch In CHOP. It will show the internal queue size and whether it is dropping or missing data (`queue_advanced_total` and `queue_retarded_total` should not be increasing, and `queue_length` should not be zero).

**NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues, confirm Windows Firewall is disabled for TouchDesigner.**

## Parameters - Touch In Page

Protocol `protocol` - ⊞ - Selects which network protocol to use to transfer data. Different protocol's have methods of connecting and using the address parameter. For more information refer to the [Network Protocols](Network_Protocols.html "Network Protocols") article.

* Streaming (TCP/IP) `streaming` -

Address `address` - The computer name or IP address of the server computer. You can use an IP address (e.g. `100.123.45.78`) or the computer's network name can be used directly. If you put "`localhost`", it means the other end of the pipe is on the same computer.
Network Port `port` - The network port of the server.
Active `active` - While on, the CHOP receives information from the pipe or server. While off, no updating occurs. Data sent by a server is lost, but a pipe will store the data until Active is turned on again. If in Network mode, turning this parameter on initiates a connection, and turning it off breaks the connection.
Queue Target `queuetarget` - The target queue length the CHOP will attempt to maintain.
Queue Target Unit `queuetargetunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Queue Variance `queuevariance` - The range around the Queue Target that's acceptable. If the queue's length is within the target and variance range, the CHOP will not bother to adjust the queue length.
Queue Variance Unit `queuevarianceunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Maximum Queue `maxqueue` - The maximum size of the queue when full. Incoming samples will be dropped if the maximum queue is reached.
Max Queue Unit `maxqueueunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Queue Adjust Time `adjusttime` - Specifies how often to repeat/drop a samples in order to get closer to the queue target range. If the value = 1 and the units = seconds, then it will try to repeat/drop a sample once per second to maintain the queue target set in the Minimum Target and Maximum Target parameters above.
Adjust Unit `adjusttimeunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.
Recover Outside Range `recover` - If the queue size goes outside of the target size range for more than the 'adjust time', then if this option is on it will stop delivering new data or throw away a lot of data, until queue size is back in the middle of the min/max target. If this option is of the queue size will be slowly inched towards the target size instead (by dropping or repeating single frames every once in a while).
Use Synced Ports `syncports` - ⊞ - This parameter lets you send the the data in a single global pipe if required. This can be important if various data streams must be sent in frame sync. For more information, refer to [Touch In/Out Synced Ports](https://docs.derivative.ca/Touch_In/Out_Synced_Ports "Touch In/Out Synced Ports").

* Off `off` - Uses separate ports for each port number assigned.

* On `on` - Uses a single global pipe for all Touch Out CHOPs using this Transfer Port Type. The global pipe uses port 10500 internally to send all the global port type data together at once. The Network Port parameter is still used to determine which Touch In CHOP gets the data on the receiving side.

Extra Information for the Touch In CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Touch Out CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Touch Out CHOP

The Touch Out CHOP can be used to create high speed connection between two TouchDesigner processes. Data is sent over TCP/IP. The Touch Out CHOP (server) sends it's data to a [Touch In CHOP](Touch_In_CHOP.html "Touch In CHOP") (client). The Touch Out CHOP is similar to a [Pipe Out CHOP](Pipe_Out_CHOP.html "Pipe Out CHOP") but highly optimized for TouchDesigner-to-TouchDesigner communication. For interfacing with other software or devices, see the [Pipe Out CHOP](Pipe_Out_CHOP.html "Pipe Out CHOP").

To receive network data from another "server" computer (e.g. from a TouchDesigner Touch Out CHOP running remotely), a connection must be established between the server and the Touch In CHOP before data is sent. You must supply the Server Address and Port from which to receive incoming data to a channel. The server should be listening for connections on the port that this CHOP is using. Multiple Touch In CHOPs (clients) can receive data from a single Touch Out CHOP (server).

## Parameters - Trace Page

TOP Name `top` - Specify the TOP image to trace.
Threshold `thresh` - Brightness level value adjusts where trace outline in image occurs.
Add Point Texture `addtexture` - This option allows the generation of point texture coordinates (UVs). This may occasionally be necessary when the Convert to Poly option is enabled.
Remove Borders `delborder` - When enabled, this option eliminates extraneous data along the edges of the original image so it isn't traced. This is useful for when "dirty" edges exist in the original image that you don't want traced.
Compute Normals `normals` - Creates normals on the geometry.

Border Width `bordwidth` - The number of pixels the removal border should be.
Resample Shapes `doresample` - Determines level of refinement (number of points) for generating trace outlines.
Step Size `step` - Value controlling trace outline refinement when Resample Shapes is checked.
Smooth Shapes `dosmooth` - When this option is checked, the geometry is filtered to remove sharp corners.
Corner Delta `corner` - Value controlling corner smoothing when `Smooth Shapes` is checked.
Fit to Curves `fitcurve` - If selected, the geometry at this point is converted to two-dimensional Bzier curves. Flat edges are preserved in polygons.
Fitting Error `error` - Value controlling accuracy of the above curve fitting process. For best results, the input should retain as many points as possible, i.e. do not select Smooth Shapes or Resample Shapes.
Convert to Poly `convpoly` - This option will convert the above curves back into polygons.
Level of Detail `lod` - This value controls the accuracy of the conversion back into polygons.
Hole Faces `hole` - This will bridge all holes in the output so that they may be rendered properly. Bzier curves and polygons can be holed, but polygonal holing sometimes produces better results. You may want to use the Convert to Poly option before holing.

# Trail CHOP

The Trail CHOP displays a history of its input channels back in time. A window of time is displayed from the current frame back in time, the size of this window is set by the Window Length parameter. The last sample in the Trail CHOP is a sample of the input at the current frame.   
  
**Note:** If the input channels change in number or names, the Trail CHOP clears its trails and begins anew. You can use a [Replace CHOP](Replace_CHOP.html "Replace CHOP") in this case to create stand in values.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[trailCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/TrailCHOP_Class "TrailCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Trail Page

Active `active` - When On the Trail CHOP will record its input.
Grow Length `growlength` - When On the length of the Trail CHOP's recording will keep getting longer as the timeline moves forward. Use this for recording any length as needed.
Window Length `wlength` - The amount of history recorded is set by Window Length. The Units menu on the right determine which units to use in the parameter (Samples, Frames, Seconds). A setting of 4 seconds will show the value of the input channel for the previous 4 seconds.
Window Length Unit `wlengthunit` - Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for the Window Length parameter.
Capture `capture` - ⊞ - Determines when to capture values.

* Time Slice `timeslice` - Captures a sliding window of the input every cook. Useful for capturing a continuous log.

* Only When Input Cooks `inputcooks` - Captures the input only whenever the input cooks. Useful for capturing discrete events separated by long pauses.

Resample `resample` - Enable parameter below to resample the output to a different length.
Resample `samples` - Resample the output to this specified length.
Rate `setrate` - Enable parameter below to use a different sample rate.
Sample Rate `rate` - Resample using this sample rate instead of the global frame rate (`$FPS`).
Reset `reset` - While On, this toggle resets the channel(s) to 0.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Click to instantly resets the channel(s) to 0.

Trail SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Trail SOP

The Trail SOP takes an input SOP and makes a trail of each point of the input SOP over the past several frames, and connects the trails in different ways. It will generate trails of any input geometry, whether it is a cube translating, a deforming surface, or particles. This is useful for multi-frame ghosting effects and temporal modelling.

When using a [Particle SOP](Particle_SOP.html "Particle SOP") or [Spring SOP](Spring_SOP.html "Spring SOP") as input, it is important to keep the trail increment to integer values. Otherwise, the trail will not work well.

* [4 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)
* [5 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [5.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [5.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Result Type `result` - ⊞ - How to construct the trail geometry.

* Preserve Original `preserve` - Preserves the original geometry.

* Connect as Mesh `mesh` - Connects the resulting points as a mesh.

* Connect as Polygons `poly` - Connects the resulting points as polygons.

* Compute velocity `velocity` - As the points move faster, corresponding velocity attributes are computed.

Trail Length `length` - This sets the length of the trail by establishing the maximum number of frames for the Trail SOP to use, i.e. a Trail Length of `25`will connect the geometry from the previous twenty-five frames.
Trail Increment `inc` - This will skip the given number of frames to build a trail with fewer points in it, but the same length. This will lower the resolution of the trail by reducing the number of points in the trail. This is better for ghosting when using Preserve Original. If you set the Increment to `2` or more, you will see the same length trail, but fewer copies of the geometry.
Cache Size `cache` - The number of frames to keep cached in available memory.
Evaluate Within Frame Range `evalframe` - This option specifies that the Trail SOP will only evaluate, or cook, within the current frame range (`$FSTART`, `$FEND`). If this option is not enabled, the SOP can evaluate prior to the start frame.
Connectivity `surftype` - ⊞ - This option is used to select the type of surface, when using a Mesh Primitive Type.

Close Rows `close` - When selected, closes the rows in the output selection.
Velocity Scale `velscale` - Scales the velocity by a specific value when Compute Velocity is selected.
Reset `reset` - While on, clears any cached geometries, resetting the trail to mirror the input.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Reset the geometry for a single frame.

### Velocity Computation

The particles thrown off the end-most points recieve a higher velocity than those close to the root of the L-system:

Transform CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Transform CHOP

The Transform CHOP takes transformations in various formats, applied operations to them, and outputs them in various formats. It can be used to:

* Change the position and orientation of an object.
* Convertion transforms one format to another format.
* Convert a set of transform channels with a certain transform order into an equivalent set of channels with a different transform order.
* Change the direction, starting point and scale of motion capture data or other data being calibrated to match other reference frames.

( See also the [Transform XYZ CHOP](Transform_XYZ_CHOP.html "Transform XYZ CHOP") for doing transforms on XYZ positions and vectors. )

Three transform formats exists:

* Transform with Euler angles for rotation. These are defined by channels with suffixes: `tx ty tz, rx ry rz, sx sy sz` and an optional transform and rotate order `xord and rord`.
* Transform with Quaternion for rotation. These are defined by channels with suffixes: `tx ty tz, qx qy qx qw, sx sy sz` and an optional transform order `xord`.
* A 4x4 or 3x3 matrix. These are defined by channels with suffixes: `m00, m10, m20, m30, m01, m11... m33`. Where the notation is `m[row][col]`. The matrix should be be in column-major order, that is to say, the translate portion should be in `m03, m13, m23`. The 4th row and column can be omitted to use a 3x3 matrix instead. Unlike the other formats, this format can not have arbitrary missing channels. Either 9 channels for 3x3 or 16 channels for 4x4 matrices must be provided.

The first two transform formats can be specified with missing channels, in which case default values will be used. 0s for translates and rotates, 1s for scale, and (0,0,0,1) for quaternion.

Frequently the input channels come from an [Object CHOP](Object_CHOP.html "Object CHOP") or [Parameter CHOP](Parameter_CHOP.html "Parameter CHOP"). Examples are:

* geo1:tx geo1:ty geo1:tz geo1:rx ...
* headtx headty headtz headrx
* tx ty tz rx ... (what you would get from a Parameter CHOP)
* cam1:m00 cam1:m10 cam1:m20 .... cam1:m33

### Multiple Transform Sets

Any of the above defines a transformation matrix. Multiple transform 'sets' can be specified by channels having different prefixes. Different sets using different formats can be all in the same CHOP. Formats can not be mixed within a set though. Each set will be combined with sets from the other input, and the transform on the 'Transform' page to create final transforms for each set.

If no inputs are connected to the CHOP, it will output the transform generated from the 'Transform' page.

If inputs are connected, the output will contain the same number of samples as the first input. Samples will be combined between the inputs 1:1, that is, the start/end range and the sample rate of the inputs are ignored. If the second input contains less samples than the first one, the extend conditions for that CHOP will be used to determine values for the samples coming from the 2nd CHOP that are out of range.

If multiple sets are provided, they will be matched 1st-to-1st set, 2nd-to-2nd set. If there are less sets in the second input than the first one, then it will loop over the sets. E.g if the first input as 5 sets and the second input as 2 sets, the matching will be 1st-to-1st, 2nd-to-2nd, 3rd-to-1st, 4th-to-2nd and 5th-to-1st.

### Order of Operation

The inputs will be combined together first, then the result from that will be combined with the transform defined on the 'Transform' page.

The channels of a Transform CHOP are frequently exported back to objects.

## Parameters - Input Page

This page defines what the incoming channels' transform order is assumed to be. Using the incoming channels and the transform order here, a matrix for the incoming channels in built. It is then multiplied by the transformation matrix defined by the Transform page and output.

Any missing translation, rotation or scale channels will default to zero (or one in the case of scale).

Custom Input Orders `custinputorders` - This allows the input order, if provided, to be ignored and overridden by a custom order chosen by the following two parameters.
Transform Order `inxord` - ⊞ - Changing the Transform order will change where things go much the same way as going a block and turning east gets you to a different place than turning east and then going a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T \* R \* S \* Position

Input 0 Pre Operation `input0preop` - ⊞ - Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 0, before they are combined with other transforms.

* None `none` - No operation is applied.

* Invert `invert` - Invert the transform.

* Transpose `transpose` - Transpose the transform. This only has an effect for matrix format transforms.

* Invert Transpose `inverttranspose` - Invert and Transpose the transform. The transpose will only be done if the input is a matrix format transform.

Input 1 Pre Operation `input1preop` - ⊞ - Operation(s) to apply on the transforms on Input 1, before they are combined with other transforms.

Input Operation `inputoperation` - ⊞ - The operation that should be applied between transforms coming from Input 0 and Input 1. Refer to the main description of this node for an explanation of how multiple samples and/or transform sets are combined between the two inputs.

* Input 0, then Input 1 `input0input1` - The operation will be `input1 * input0`. It it ordered this way since ultimately the transform is applied to a position/vector in the form input1 \* input0 \* Position, so the input0 operation is done first.

* Input 1, then Input 0 `input1input0` - The operation will be `input1 * input0`.

* Quaternion Lerp `quatlerp` -

* Quaternion Slerp `quatslerp` -

Input Weight `inputweight` - Specify the Blend weight for the above 'Input Operation'

This page defines an additional transform that can be combined with the transform created by combining the inputs, if any. If the node has no inputs connected then the transform generated from this page will be what is output from this node.

Transform Order `xord` - ⊞ - See description from earlier Transform Order parameter.

Rotate Order `rord` - ⊞ - See description from earlier Rotate Order parameter.

Xform Matrix/CHOP/DAT `xformmatrixop` -
Multiply Order `multiplyorder` - ⊞ - Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors).

* Input, then Transform Page `inputxformpage` - The transforms will be combined as `Transform Page * Input`.

* Transform Page, then Input `xformpageinput` - The transforms will be combined as `Input * Transform Page`.

Look At `lookat` - Allows you to generate your transform channels by specifying an object you would like to Look At, or point to. The generated transform channels will be such that when you transform an object using it, it will make the object face your intended Look At Object. This is useful if, for instance, you want a camera to follow another object's movements. The Look At parameter points the object in question at the other object's origin.

**Tip:** To designate a centre of interest for the camera that doesn't appear in your scene, create a Null object and disable its display flag. Then Parent the Camera to the newly created Null object, and tell the camera to look at this object using the Look At parameter. You can direct the attention of the camera by moving the Null object with the Select state. If you want to see both the camera and the Null object, enable the Null object's display flag, and use the Select state in an additional Viewport by clicking one of the icons in the top-right corner of the TouchDesigner window.

Up Vector `upvector` - ⊞ - When orienting an object, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.

Pre Operation `preop` - ⊞ - Operation(s) to apply on the transform generated by Transform/Rotate/Scale/Pivot parameters, before it is combined with other transforms. Done before combining with the Xform Matrix and Look At.

* None `none` - No operation.

Operation `operation` - ⊞ - Controls how the input transform(s) are combined with the transform specified on this page. The below two descriptions use a multiply "vector on the right" convention (column vectors).

Weight `weight` - Specify the Blend weight for the above 'Operation'

This page controls what information is output from the node.

Post Operation `postop` - ⊞ - Optionally applied one last operation to the final generated transform before it is output.

Output `output` - ⊞ - Specify the format the transform will be output in.

* Transform (Euler) `transform` - The standard Translate, Rotate and Scale channels. t[xyz], r[xyz], s[xyz]. Will also include xord and rord channels for Transform and Rotate Order, unless 'Include Order Channels' is turned off.

* Transform (Quaternion) `transformquat` - Translate, Quaternion (for rotation) and Scale channels. t[xyz], q[xyzw], s[xyz]. Will also include xord channel for Transform Order, unless 'Include Order Channels' is turned off.

* 4x4 Matrix `mat` - 16 channels for a 4x4 matrix. The channels will be output in column-by-column order. That is, with the last 4 channels being the 'translate' portion of the matrix.

* 3x3 Matrix `mat3` - 9 channels for a 3x3 matrix. This includes the rotation and the scale, but not the translation.

* Position `position` - The final position of the transform in space. This doesn't include any orientation information.

Determinant `determ` - When outputting a matrix, it's determinant can also be output by enabling this parameter.
Un-matched Channels `unmatchedchans` - ⊞ - Controls how channels that don't match the naming convention for the various transform format are treated.

* Warn `warn` - Give a warning if transform channels that don't match any of the naming convenstions are found.

* Ignore `ignore` - Ignore (give no warning) if channels that don't match the naming convention are found.

* Delete `delete` - Delete all channels that don't match any of the naming conventions.

Custom Output Orders `custoutputorders` - By default the output transforms will use the orders given on teh Transform page. Enabling this allows for custom orders to be used for the transform that is output. This doesn't change the transform itself, but the values of the channels will likely change since they are combined in a different order to obtain the same overall transform.
Transform Order `outxord` - ⊞ - See description from earlier Transform Order parameter.

Include Order Channels `includeorderchans` - Specified if the 'xord' and 'rord' channels should be output from this node. 'xord' will be output for 'Transform (Euler)' and 'Transform (Quaternion)' modes. 'rord' will be output for the 'Transform (Euler)' mode. The matrix and position modes do not include orders.
Continuous Rotations `continuousrotations` - In the case the input has multiple samples, this will attempt to keep rotations of neighbouring samples continuous. Basically, it tries to avoid 360 degree jumps. 360-> 361 instead of 360 -> 1 (which is the same two rotations.
Use Rotation Hint `usehint` - An initial rotation hint given in r[xyz] degrees to try to stay continuous against. Turning this on and using the Hint parameter below allows you to specify approximate starting values for the rotation channels produced. This allows you to change the rotation channel solution to a specific starting point (e.g. for camera output control).
Hint `hint` - ⊞ - Specify approximate starting values for the rotation channels produced.

* Hint `hintx` -

* Hint `hinty` -

* Hint `hintz` -

* Input 0:  - One or more transform sets, as defined by the allowable formats described at the start of the article.

Transform SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Transform SOP

The Transform SOP translates, rotates and scales the input geometry in "object space" or local to the SOP. The Model Editor and the Transform SOP both work in "object space", and change the X Y Z positions of the points. In contrast, animating the transformation channels of an object in the Geometry Viewer Pane moves/scales the entire object in "world space" and does not affect the XYZ point positions of the geometry.

Transform XYZ CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Transform XYZ CHOP

The Transform XYZ CHOP is used to transform positions and vector. The difference between transforming a position vs. a vector is that a vector won't have the translation portion of the transformation applied to it.  
  
The Transform XYZ CHOP first groups the channels from the first input by looking for '`x`', '`y`' and '`z`' as the last character in the channel names. Then it treats each of the sets created as either a Position or a Vector depending on the parameter choice. The second input can be connected, and must describe a transform in the same format of channels that the [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP") supports. The second input is combined with the 'Transform' page parameters, and the resulting transform is applied to the input positions and vectors.  
  
CHOPs with multiple-samples can be provided, which allows for larger amount of positional data to be transformed in a single CHOP.

See also the [Transform CHOP](Transform_CHOP.html "Transform CHOP").

Trigger CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Trigger CHOP

The Trigger CHOP starts an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger pulses in the input channels. A trigger point occurs whenever the first input's channel increases across the trigger threshold value. Most commonly, an ADSR starts when the input goes from 0 to 1.

**Note**: To get a channel with the full waveform, turn off the Time Slice parameter on the Common page, and don't connect an input.

The envelope consists of six major sections: delay, attack, peak, decay, sustain and release.

From the time the threshold is reached and while the channel's value is above the release threshold, the envelope is in its sustain phase during which it will delay, attack, peak-hold, decay and then maintain its sustain value.

After the inputs drops below the release threshold, the envelope start its release phase and will drop to 0.

The peak and sustain levels can be set independently, but peak value can never be less than sustain.

This CHOP works with both time-sliced inputs or with static input channels.

For jittery inputs, if you don't want it to trigger until its input has been On for some period, see the [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") for the Trigger CHOP, example "trigger after a time threshold", which uses the Count CHOP.

**Note**: See examples in OP Snippets.

Trim CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Trim CHOP

The Trim CHOP shortens or lengthens the input's channels. A part of the interval can be preserved or removed. If the channels are being lengthened, the extend conditions of the channel will be used to get the new values.

The Trim CHOP is sometimes used to get a 1-sample value at the current frame, where the inputs are channels at frame 0 or channels at some other frame range.

The handles on the Trim CHOP in the graph can interactively adjust its length.

See also [Splice CHOP](Splice_CHOP.html "Splice CHOP"), [Delete CHOP](Delete_CHOP.html "Delete CHOP"), [Select CHOP](Select_CHOP.html "Select CHOP")

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[trimCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/TrimCHOP_Class "TrimCHOP Class")

Unit Values `relative` - ⊞ - Determines whether the Start/End parameters are expressed as absolute numbers (relative to time 0) or numbers that are relative to the start and end of the input channels.

* Absolute `abs` - The Start and End are the actual numbers defining the new interval.

* Relative to Start/End `rel` - The Start and End are relative to the start and end of the input CHOP.

* Relative to Current Frame `cur` - Only one sample is output, containing the channel values at the current frame.

* Current Time Slice `slice` - Channel value is based on the current time slice.

Start `start` - The start of the range to trim. The numbers are expressed in seconds, frames or samples, depending on units menu for each parameter.
Start Unit `startunit` -
End `end` - The end of the range to trim. The numbers are expressed in seconds, frames or samples, depending on units menu for each parameter.
End Unit `endunit` -

**NOTE:** If the Start Value is greater than the End Value, the Trim CHOP will behave as if both values are the Start Value.

Discard `discard` - ⊞ - Which part of the channel to discard:

* Exterior `exterior` - Discard those parts of the channel outside the trim range.

* Interior `interior` - Discard the interior of the trim range. If two intervals remain, sequence them together.

The CHOP is shortened by increasing the Start relative value, and lengthened by decreasing it. The CHOP is lengthened by increasing the End relative value, and shortened by decreasing it.

Trim SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Trim SOP

The Trim SOP cuts out parts of a spline surface, or uncuts previously cut pieces. When a portion of the surface is trimmed, it is not actually removed from the surface; instead, that part is made invisible. This means that you can still modify the surface (modify the position of its points, for instance) that is not displayed in order to affect the part that is displayed.

The surface can be trimmed by specifying open or closed profiles as inside or outside regions. The profiles need not be contained within the domain (UV space) of the surface; they can also be nested.

Open profiles are treated as follows: if both ends of the profile are inside the surface, the ends are connected to one another; if the profile's ends are outside the domain of the surface they are projected onto, that part of the surface appears to be cut away.

You will usually need a Trim SOP, [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP"), or [Profile SOP](Profile_SOP.html "Profile SOP") after a [Project SOP](Project_SOP.html "Project SOP").

* Use a Trim SOP to cut a hole in the projected surface.
* Use a [Bridge SOP](Bridge_SOP.html "Bridge SOP") to skin the profile curve to another profile curve.
* Use a [Profile SOP](Profile_SOP.html "Profile SOP") to extract the curve on surface or remap it's position.

### Selection Method - Winding Rule

The selection method employed for clarifying overlapping trim loops is the winding rule, which executes overlapping commands instead of having them cancel each other out.

**Tip:** Since only surfaces containing profile curves can be trimmed, you will always need a Project or [Carve SOP](Carve_SOP.html "Carve SOP") in the chain above the Trim SOP.

Group `group` - This field allows you to specify the group that you would like to trim. You can select the group from the pop-up menu, or specify a points and primitives range.

You can specify profile curves within the group by providing a profile pattern (e.g. `*.3` specifies the fourth profile in all spline surfaces).

`optype` - ⊞ - The types of trimming operations available.

* Keep Outside `keepout` - Trims the interior of the curve, or makes a hole in the display of the surface. Keeping what's outside the profile curve generates an outer trim loop in order to define the limits of the surface to be displayed-the surface that's outside of the profile curve.

* Keep Inside `keepin` - Keeps the interior of the curve and removes the display of everything else.

* Keep Natural `keepnatural` - Trim based on the natural orientation of the profiles, be they open or not. Counter-clockwise profiles keep their interior, generating a result similar to Keep Inside. Clockwise profiles discard their interior, similar to Keep Outside, and may require an explicit outer trim-loop if none is present.

* Untrim `untrim` - Turns the trim curve into a plain profile.

* Change Altitude `chgalt` -

Process Profiles Individually `individual` - When this option is off, the trim loops in the group (or all the loops on the surfaces if no group has been specified) will be considered together to form a region. It will report the first region that is found. That is, if more than one closed loop could be formed by joining the lines, there is no guarantee that the region is trimmed. Also, if there is a closed loop in the group of loops, then just that loop is used.

If the loops on the surface don't form a closed loop, then the SOP will attempt to form a region by using the boundary of the region. If all the loops make a total of two intersections with the boundary, then it will attempt to form the loop by forming it around the boundary.

**For example:** Use the [Carve SOP](Carve_SOP.html "Carve SOP") to extract four profiles: two in U, and two in V. Pipe that into a Trim SOP and turn this option off. The four profiles will define a region to be trimmed. Notice that the profile end-points do not coincide, and the profiles are not parametrically continuous, nor are they created in the proper order. Despite all this, the Trim SOP is able to figure out the hole.

Build outer Trim-Loop Explicitly `bigloop` - This option allows you to specify that an outer trim loop be built. It is useful where you have more than one profile curve on the surface and are performing several successive trim operations involving both the Keep Inside and Keep Outside options (see example, below).

**Tip:** An outer trim loop must be generated the first time you punch a hole in the surface, but not if you just keep the contents of that hole and throw away the rest. By default, the outer loop (which goes all around the domain boundary) is built for you automatically. Sometimes, however, you first do a **Keep Inside**, then a **Keep Outside** with an area that's not inside the preserved regions, so you may want the outer curve at that point. That is when this parameter is useful.

Trimming Tolerance `trimtol` - How close two trim curves must be to each other or to the edge of the patch in order to be considered an intersection.
Altitude `altitude` - You can specify the altitude of the trim. The `$ALTITUDE` variable is the surface's current altitude. This marks the transition for the surface from trimmed in to trimmed out.

The following results were obtained by using a [Project SOP](Project_SOP.html "Project SOP") to project two NURBS circles onto a NURBS grid. Then two Trim SOPs were added, one after the other, to the [Project SOP](Project_SOP.html "Project SOP") . The first Trim SOP was set to Keep Inside, while the second Trim SOP had it's operation changed as indicated.

Twist SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Twist SOP

The Twist SOP performs non-linear deformations such as bend, linear taper, shear, squash and stretch, taper and twist. Each deformation will distort the object in one or more axes.

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[twistSOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/TwistSOP_Class "TwistSOP Class")

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Operation `op` - ⊞ - This menu allows you to select a type of non-linear deformation. Select from the following options:

* Twist `twist` - Rotates the input geometry around the Primary Axis.

* Bend `bend` - Bends the input geometry about the Primary Axis while keeping points on the Secondary Axis stationary.

* Shear `shear` - Shears the input geometry along the Secondary Axis while looking down the Primary Axis.

* Taper `taper` - Tapers the input geometry along the Secondary Axis while looking down the Primary Axis.

* Linear Taper `ltaper` - Tapers the input geometry as with the Taper option; however, only the edges remain straight through the Taper operation.

* Squash & Stretch `squash` - Traditional animator's bounce tools.

Primary Axis `paxis` - ⊞ - These menus allows you to select the primary and secondary axes for the deformation. The selected deformation will first occur in the Primary Axis and then the Secondary Axis.

* X Axis `x` - This field allows you to choose the origin of the deformation.

* Y Axis `y` - This field allows you to choose the origin of the deformation.

* Z Axis `z` - This field allows you to choose the origin of the deformation.

Secondary Axis `saxis` - ⊞ - These menus allows you to select the primary and secondary axes for the deformation. The selected deformation will first occur in the Primary Axis and then the Secondary Axis.

Pivot `p` - ⊞ - This field allows you to choose the origin of the deformation.

Strength `strength` - The Strength of the effect being applied. The Rolloff determines an accentuation of the effect being applied. When you are using different types of transformations this Strength / Roll will have different effects:

* Bend - Strength and Roll are used to control the extremities of the geometry (try a value of 0.5).
* Twist - Strength and Roll are used to affect the twist amount based on the distance.
* Shear - Strength and Roll are used to affect the shear amount based on distance.
* Taper - Strength and Roll are used to affect the direction of the bow (inwards vs. outwards).
* Linear Taper - Strength and Roll have no effect for this option.
* Squash and Stretch - Strength and Roll are used to maintain the apparent volume of the source geometry.

Typically, Rolloff should equal `1` - which spreads the effect evenly (although not being limited to) across the bounds of the geometry. Values higher than `1` iterate the effect multiple times through the same range. If Rolloff equals `0`, then the effect may be localised to a small segment at the centre of the deformed geometry and Strength may not appear to work properly.

**Note:** To be certain to see the effects of the Twist SOP, make sure you have enough divisions along the edges. By using a centre that is different from that of the object you can improve your control of the object. Try moving the pivot point to the bottom of an object that you are squashing and stretching.

Rolloff `roll` - The Strength of the effect being applied. The Rolloff determines an accentuation of the effect being applied. When you are using different types of transformations this Strength / Roll will have different effects:

UDP In DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# UDP In DAT

The UDP In DAT is used for receiving information over a UDP connection between two remotely located computers. It captures all the messages without any queuing or buffering, and allows you to send it any messages you want. Once this DAT has received a message it can reply to the sender using the 'send' command. Using the send command before it has received a message will not work because it doesn't know where to send data yet. When in multicast mode it doesn't send out a multicast message, it sends a reply directly to the originator for the last multicast message it got.

Undo Class - Derivative

# Undo Class

A class to enable and disable undo functionality. Undo blocks can be created in scripts. At the end of callbacks, any dangling undo blocks will be terminated. See [examples](#Undo_Block_Examples) at bottom of page.

This class is available as a member of the global [UI Class](UI_Class.html "UI Class"), via `ui.undo`.

* [1 Members](#Members)
* [2 Methods](#Methods)
* [3 Undo Block Examples](#Undo_Block_Examples)
  + [3.1 Undo Callbacks](#Undo_Callbacks)

`globalState` → `bool` :

> Is global undo enabled or not.

`redoStack` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> A list of names for redo operations available.

`state` → `bool` **(Read Only)**:

> Is undo enabled or not.

`undoStack` → `list` **(Read Only)**:

> A list of names for undo operations available.

`startBlock(name, enable=True)`→ `None`:

> Start a named undo block. While the block is active, any script changes to TouchDesigner objects that are undoable in the editor will be added to the undo stack.
> 
> * name - The name of the block, which should briefly describe the change that would be undone.
> * enable - In the rare case you want to insert a block that doesn't store undo info within a block that does, you can create a block with enable off. Example:
> 
> ```
> # undoing this will remove the noiseTOP and noiseSOP only.
> 
> ui.undo.startBlock("constant1 r = 0")
> a = op('constant1').par.colorr = 0
> ui.undo.startBlock("constant2 g = 0", enable=False)
> a = op('constant2').par.colorg = 0
> ui.undo.endBlock()
> a = op('constant3').par.colorb = 0
> ui.undo.endBlock()
> 
> ```

> Clear undo and redo stack. This will terminate any current undo blocks.

`addCallback(callback, info=None)`→ `None`:

> Add a Python callback into the current undo block.
> 
> The callback should be defined as `def yourCallbackName(isUndo, info)`. The `isUndo` argument tells if the call is an undo or a redo (the same callback is used for both) and the `info` argument is the same Python object passed to `addCallback`, and should contain any information needed to perform the undo/redo.
> 
> * callback - user defined callback function. Should be defined as `callback(isUndo, info)`
> * info - this argument will be passed back to user in the callback

`redo()`→ `None`:

> Redo the next operation. This will terminate any current undo blocks.

`undo()`→ `None`:

> Undo the last operation. This will terminate any current undo blocks.

`endBlock()`→ `None`:

> Terminate an undo block.

## Undo Block Examples

Setting up an undo block is as simple as starting it and then doing any changes that the editor can normally undo:

```
ui.undo.startBlock("Change Title Text")
op('title').par.text = 'Making Your Own Undo System'
op('title').par.fontsize = 30
ui.undo.endBlock()

After running this script, performing an undo action will change the referenced `text` and `fontsize` parameters to go back to whatever their previous values were. Redo functionality is similarly automatic.

### Undo Callbacks

You can also perform Python actions as part of an undo stack. This is necessary when you are changing something that the TouchDesigner editor does not know how to undo, such as changing [extension](Extensions.html "Extensions") values. The undo callback takes an info argument, which should be used to provide both undo and redo information to the callback.

# an undo callback must be defined before it is referenced by ui.undo.addCallback

# this callback will be called when TouchDesigner is trying to undo a block in which it was added
def undoMasterChange(isUndo, info):
	# isUndo tells whether this call is an undo or a redo
    # info is any Python object, provided by the user
	if isUndo: # True means undo
    	ext.MasterExt.data = info['prev'] # change data back to what we stored as "prev"
    else: # False means redo
        ext.MasterExt.data = info['new'] # change data back to what we stored as "new"

newData = 'new stuff'

# start the block
ui.undo.startBlock("Update Master Data")

# store undo/redo info
info = {'prev': ext.MasterExt.data, 'new': newData)

# next, perform the change
ext.MasterExt.data = newData

# TouchDesigner doesn't know how to undo the above, so add the callback
ui.undo.addCallback(undoMasterChange, info)

# you can mix callbacks with normal undoable items, so the next line will be added to the block
op('master').par.Version += 1

# end the block
ui.undo.endBlock()

**Note:** The order that things are added to the undo block can matter. When **undoing**, changes will be undone and callbacks will be run in the **reverse order** that they were received in the undo block. When **redoing**, changes will be made in the same order they were originally received in the undo block.

USD COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# USD COMP

The USD COMP loads and imports most geometric schemas from a [USD](USD.html "USD") file in crate/binary or ASCII file formats with extensions as (`.usd`), (`.usda`), (`.usdc`), and (`.usdz`). Currently the USD version 0.18.9 is being used in USD COMP. You can drag-drop a USD file into a TouchDesigner network, or import it via the USD File parameter. See also [File Types](File_Types.html "File Types").

To open a USD file in an USD COMP:

1) Specify a valid file path in the "USD File" parameter, including the name of the file with correct .usd extension.

2) This step is varied depending on whether the USD COMP is just created and if any changes in the default values of parameters are required or not. If the file is being loaded for the first time in the network and the default parameter values are accepted then simply press the "Build Network" to generate the USD network and import the assets. Note that we recommend toggling the "Merge Geometry" for any medium or large files as it can significantly improve performance. Generally, any changes in the parameters above the "Build Network" requires the network to be built again.

3) The "Reload" button is being used for reloading the internal assets (e.g. meshes, points, etc.) and this is specifically useful if the file has moved to another location and when the `.toe` file is opened the assets were not found and reloaded properly.

4) The "Update" button is used when some changes on USD file are made and we want to merge those changes into the current network without fully rebuilding it.

Here are some examples: <https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/quick-look/>

See also: [USD](USD.html "USD"), [USD In TouchDesigner](https://docs.derivative.ca/USD_In_TouchDesigner "USD In TouchDesigner"), [Import Select CHOP](Import_Select_CHOP.html "Import Select CHOP"), [Import Select TOP](Import_Select_TOP.html "Import Select TOP"), [Import Select SOP](Import_Select_SOP.html "Import Select SOP"), [FBX COMP](FBX_COMP.html "FBX COMP")

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[usdCOMP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/UsdCOMP_Class "UsdCOMP Class")

## Parameters - USD Page

USD File `file` - The path to the USD file. The file can be a binary (.usd or .usdc) or ASCII format (.usda).
Reload File `reload` - A pulse to reload the assets from the file without making any changes to the existing network.
Use Material `usematerial` - A toggle to specify whether the material/shading be enabled for all the geometry primitives with material binding or not. By turning this toggle on, the MAT nodes and -according to the need- the ImportSelect TOPs for texture mapping assets are generated.
Cameras `cameras` - A toggle to specify whether the Camera nodes (subject to be defined in the USD file) created for the USD COMP or not.
Generate Actor COMPs `genactors` - When enabled, will generate Actor COMPs in place of Geometry COMPs as the parents' of Import Select SOPs.
Merge Geometry `mergegeo` - A toggle to merge the mergeable geometries SOPs and their transformation COMPs up to a specified merge level. This feature can noticeably increase the performance of the USD COMP network.
Merge Level `mergelevel` - Defines the desired merge level for merging the nodes. The start value is 1 which is the root of the network and it increases for the children of nodes the same as their positions within tree hierarchy. By default, this parameter is disabled and can be enabled once the toggle for Merge Geometry is set to ON.
Max Wired Children `maxwiredchildren` - This value is used to define how many wired children a Geometry/Null COMP node can have on the same network level (note that this network level refers to all the nodes that can be seen on the same canvas network). If a node has more children than this value, all its children will be relocated inside of it. This is used to prune out the wired children nodes of a parent node to make a lighter and cleaner network. The default value is 5.
Compute Normals `computenormals` - A toggle for generating normal vectors from subdivision schema specified from USD file using OpenSubdiv library. Turning this toggle to OFF makes will make the SOPs use the TouchDesigner generated normal instead (only CPU mode).
Direct to GPU `gpudirect` - A toggle to load the geometry directly to the GPU. This makes the rendering much faster than CPU mode. However, currently the only supported geometries are mesh and point primitives. If a USD scene contains other prim types such as NURBs Patches, an error will be generated for each [Import Select SOP](Import_Select_SOP.html "Import Select SOP") that is not supported.
Build Network `buildnetwork` - Every time (including the first time) you specify a new file, or change any parameter from the USD page, you need to re-build it, so it generates the network according to the current selected parameters.
Keep Parameters `keepparams` - A toggle to keep the parameters of the current network over parameters of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.
Keep Connections `keepconnections` - A toggle to keep the connection of the current network over the connections of the re-imported (via Update parameter) network.
Update `update` - Updates the network. This option is specifically useful when the USD file is edited after the USD network is imported in TouchDesigner.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The Callbacks DAT will execute during import or update allowing for modification and customization of the imported operators and resulting network.

This page includes the animation controls parameters of USD within TouchDesigner.

Shift Animation Start `shiftanimationstart` - A toggle to specify whether to shift the animation to the start of animation indicated in the USD file.
Sample Rate Mode `sampleratemode` - ⊞ - A menu to choose between the file FPS or custom sample rate.

* File FPS `filefps` - uses the FPS from what is defined in the USD file.

* Custom `custom` - uses a desired value specified by Sample Rate parameter.

Extend Left `textendleft` - ⊞ - Determines how USD COMP handles animation positions that lie before the Trim Start position. For example, if Trim Start is set to 1, and the animation current index is -10, the Extend Left menu determines how the animation position is calculated.

Extend Right `textendright` - ⊞ - Determines how USD COMP handles animation positions that lie after the Trim End position. For example, if Trim End is set to 20, and the animation current index is 25, the Extend Right menu determines how the animation position is calculated.

Extra Information for the USD COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

## Control External Devices[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Control External Devices")]

Get data in-from and out-to external devices using CHOPs. Through [MIDI](MIDI.html "MIDI"), [OSC](OSC.html "OSC"), [Shared Memory](Shared_Memory.html "Shared Memory"), or custom C++ programs (via [Pipe In CHOP](Pipe_In_CHOP.html "Pipe In CHOP") and [Pipe Out CHOP](Pipe_Out_CHOP.html "Pipe Out CHOP"), data can pass in and out of TouchDesigner in a multitude of ways. Such inputs can be used to control any part of your Touch project, or conversely, Touch can control external devices by sending CHOP data out via any of these methods.

## Real-Time Puppeteering[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Real-Time Puppeteering")]

You can attach the mouse, MIDI or other devices to objects one at a time and perform the motion of the object, building up the motion of a character or object, piece by piece. You can perform these "gestures" with the mouse or other devices and capture the motion in a chop. You can edit the captured motion immediately by trimming, shifting, smoothing, and then combining it with other motion clips. TouchDesigner's realtime puppeteering is a unique way of rapidly creating motion.

## Dynamics and Special Effects Motion[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Dynamics and Special Effects Motion")]

The creation of special motion effects is easier with CHOPs. You can detect events in the 3D scene, like collisions or direction changes, and then trigger the start of other motion. CHOPs include many tools to smooth curves, simulate physical motion, and add natural-looking random variations to motion. For example, CHOPs can be assembled to simulate physical camera motion, including lags, shakes, bumps and swings.

## Non-Destructive Motion Editing[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Non-Destructive Motion Editing")]

You can edit motion using CHOPs in a way that doesn't affect the original motion channels. You can change the timing of motion by shifting, compressing, expanding and warping time. You can apply operators that smooth, reverse, repeat, trim and extend motion. You can go back to any CHOP, change its effect on the resulting motion, and experiment with modified timing easily.

## Motion Compositing[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Motion Compositing")]

A group of CHOPs, each containing a motion clip for a character, can be sequenced one after the other, with controls over the blending transition between the motion clips. You can start with one motion clip and temporarily override it with another motion clip. Motion can be layered so that gestures can temporarily and partially override other gestures. Because you can experiment on the blending without destroying the original data, you can easily fine tune layered motion.

## Facial Animation and Lip Sync[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Facial Animation and Lip Sync")]

Facial motion can be animated from a set of facial expressions, made of poses and motion clips. Facial poses and motion clips can be composed from other poses and facial motion clips and then re-used.

Lip sync is the facial animation task that uses a voice soundtrack and a library of mouth poses to animate a character's mouth. You can import a voice track, add words of the dialogue to the time line, drop mouth poses and gestures on the time line, then adjust the timing of the poses. You can also filter and smooth the audio to automatically generate approximate mouth motion.

## Motion Capture Editing[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Motion Capture Editing")]

You can import motion capture clips from mocap systems. Defects in captured motion can be cleaned up. Motion capture data can be applied to an inverse or forward kinematics character model, and you can further refine the motion with CHOPs. A CHOP holds multiple-channels of motion. You can easily attach and detach different motion capture moves to one character.

## Keyframe Pose Interpolation[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Keyframe Pose Interpolation")]

CHOPs provides an alternative way to hand-edit keyframing in Touch, aside from the channel keyframing documented in the User Guide.

Within CHOPs you can pose a character, snapshot the angles and IK end-effectors into a single CHOP, sequence several poses one after another, then adjust a timing curve in another CHOP to interpolate between poses. You can easily edit the poses and timing, and you can copy-paste poses and animation to other characters.

## Audio Editing[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Audio Editing")]

You can import audio into Touch from external sources and then trim, filter, resample, sync and mix the sound. You can attach mixed audio to the animation timeline. The 3D animation can be synchronized with the soundtrack with the help of timeline scrubbing and text annotation on the timeline.

## Audio Synthesis and 3D Sound[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Audio Synthesis and 3D Sound")]

Sound effects can be imported from external sources, but audio can also be synthesized from scratch using built-in audio oscillators, filters, reverb and volume controls. Sound effects can then be triggered by any event or motion in the 3D scene, or a sound can be continuously looped. Then the audio can be placed anywhere in the 3D environment of the animation, with audio cues like left-right pan, distance attenuation, muffling and doppler shift. Sounds can be triggered to help users understand conditions in the 3D scene, such as character joint limits. Audio is generated in realtime, or more complex audio can be "rendered" and played back with the animation.

## Visual Expression Language[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Visual Expression Language")]

CHOPs make a math expression language both visual and interactive. You can build the equivalent math expressions with CHOPs without having to code with a compiler. Using CHOPs you can interactively build expressions and see the results in a graph or Viewport immediately. There is no typing and therefore no "syntax errors". CHOPs do arithmetic, fetch data from other objects and more.

## Motion Management for Large Projects[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Uses_of_CHOPs&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Motion Management for Large Projects")]

A team of animators can maintain many motion clips in a central library. Motion can be easily moved between animators and scenes. CHOPs are a convenient way of managing motion of large projects, where clips for many characters are spread across many scenes. Several animators can work on single characters. Through motion compositing, you can build up or "composite" character motion from a library of motion clips, and then hand-modify them. This helps keep a consistent look for character, especially when several artists animate the same character.

Vector Class - Derivative

# Vector Class

The vector class holds a single 3 component vector. A vector describes a direction in space, and it's important to use a vector or [Position](Position_Class.html "Position Class") as appropriate for the data that is being calculated. When being multiplied by a [Matrix](Matrix_Class.html "Matrix Class"), this class will implicitly have a 4th component (W component) of 0. A new vector can be created without any arguments, with 3 arguments for the x,y,z values, or with a single argument which is a variable that has 3 entries such as a list of length 3, or a position or vector.
Examples of creating a vector:

```
v = tdu.Vector() # starts as (0, 0, 0)
v2 = tdu.Vector(0, 0, -1)
values = [0, 1, 0]
v3 = tdu.Vector(values)

# vectors can be accessed like Python lists
print(v3[1])	# same as v3.y
v3[2] = 1		# same as v3.z

> Gets or sets the X component of the vector.

> Gets or sets the Y component of the vector.

> Gets or sets the Z component of the vector.

`angle(vec)`→ `float`:

> Returns the angel (in degrees) between the current vector and specified vector (vec).
> 
> ```
> d = v.angle(v2)
> 
> ```

> Scales each component of the vector by the specified values.
> 
> * x, y, z - The values to scale each component of the vector by.
> 
> ```
> v.scale(1, 2, 1)
> 
> ```

`normalize()`→ `None`:

> Makes the length of this vector 1.
> 
> ```
> m.normalize()
> 
> ```

> Returns the length of this vector.

Vertex Class - Derivative

# Vertex Class

A Vertex describes an instance to a single geometry vertex, contained within a [Prim](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") object.

> The vertex position in its [primitive](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class").

`point` → `td.Point` :

> Get or set the [point](Point_Class.html "Point Class") to which the vertex refers.

`prim` → `td.Prim` **(Read Only)**:

> The [prim](Prim_Class.html "Prim Class") to which the vertex belongs.

In addition to the above members, all attributes are members as well.

For example, if the Vertex contains texture coordinates, they may be accessed with: `Vertex.uv`

Vertex SOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Vertex SOP

The Vertex SOP allows you to edit/create attributes on a per-vertex (rather than per-point) basis. It is similar to the [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP") in this respect. It supports two inputs, and will inherit the first input source by default. If the second input have less primitives than the first input, it will cycle through the primitives and match the vertices. If the primitive in the first input has more vertices than the matching primitive in the second input, the extra vertices are ignored.

There are currently three vertex attributes supported:

* Diffuse Color
* Alpha
* Texture Coordinates

When the attribute is defined, it can only occur on either points or vertices, but not both. Thus, if the input geometry has a point attribute for diffuse color, the attribute will automatically be "elevated" to be a vertex attribute (if diffuse colors are added in the Vertex SOP).

The SOP processes every vertex of every primitive. For each vertex processed, there are variables which allow you to know the:

* Vertex number of the primitive being processed
* The number of vertices in the primitive being processed
* The point which is referenced by the vertex
* The primitive which contains the vertex
* The total number of points
* The total number of primitives

There are also local variables to find out the values of some point attributes (i.e. position, normal - if they exist), in addition to vertex attributes. To access the attributes of the second input source, append a 2 to the variable.

* [6 Info CHOP Channels](#Info_CHOP_Channels)
  + [6.1 Common SOP Info Channels](#Common_SOP_Info_Channels)
  + [6.2 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Group `group` - If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this `SOP` to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Color `doclr` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the color, adding new color, or using no color for vertex color attributes from incoming geometry.

Color `diff` - ⊞ - If you select 'Add Color' from the menu above, Cd color vertex attributes will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions below to control the values of the point colors. The attributes to modify are: `me.inputColor[0]` for red, `me.inputColor[1]` for green, `me.inputColor[2]` for blue, and `me.inputColor[3]` for alpha. If you select 'No Color' from the menu above, the Cd color vertex attribute will be removed from the SOP.

Alpha `alpha` - Control the alpha attribute in the same manner as the rgb colors above. Alpha is Cd[3] and comes from input via `me.inputColor[3]`
Texture `douvw` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the texture coordinates, adding new texture coordinates, or using no texture coordinates for the vertex texture attributes from incoming geometry.

Texture `map` - ⊞ - If you select 'Add Texture' from the menu above, uv texture coordinate vertex attributes will be added/modified in the SOP. Enter expressions here to control the values of the vertex texture coordinates here. The attributes to modify are: `me.inputTexture[0]`, `me.inputTexture[1]` and `me.inputTexture[2]`. If you select 'No Texture' from the menu above, the uv texture coordinates vertex attribute will be removed from the SOP.

Crease `docrease` - ⊞ - Select between keeping the crease, adding new crease, or using no crease for creaseweight attribute from incoming geometry.

The `Crease Weight` attribute can be used to set individual edge crease weights for sub-division surfaces (see [Subdivide SOP](Subdivide_SOP.html "Subdivide SOP") ). This vertex attribute defines the weight for the edge which goes from that vertex to the next vertex in the polygon. For example, with a triangle (which has vertices 0, 1, 2), the attribute for vertex 1 defines the crease weight for the edge (1, 2). The attribute for vertex 2 defines the crease weight for edge (2, 0). The crease weight should be greater than 0. The larger the value for crease weights, the sharper the edge will be when sub-divided.

Crease attributes can be visualized by passing them into a [Subdivide SOP](Subdivide_SOP.html "Subdivide SOP").

Crease `crease` - If you select 'Add Crease' from the menu above, enter expressions here to control the values of the creaseweights here. The attribute to modify is: me.inputVertex.creaseWeight[0]. Values for the weight of the vertex can range from 0.0001 to infinity.

Custom Attribute `attr` - Sequence of custom attributes to be added to the geometry created.
Name `attr0name` - Creates a custom attribute with this name.
Type `attr0type` - ⊞ - The type of attribute created can be selected from this menu.

### Texture Offsets

You can have set of images in a TOP, and apply all of them in one material to different parts of an object. This allows you to have a pre-rendered animation clip with the clip playing at different speeds and time offsets on different surfaces.

You can adjust the material frame time by the first vertex/point texture W component (texture coordinated are U (horizontal), V (vertical) and W (one of a set of texture images). A texture (W) value of -1 moves back in time 1 frame. This lets you apply different frames to many polygons simultaneously using the Vertex SOP, or [Point SOP](Point_SOP.html "Point SOP").

Extra Information for the Vertex SOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Video Device In TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Video Device In TOP

The Video Device In TOP can be used to capture video from an external camera, capture card, capture dongle, IP camera, or video decoder connected to the system. Multiple devices can simultaneously stream video into TouchDesigner by using multiple Device In TOPs. HD-SDI video can be streamed into TouchDesigner through capture cards such and those from [Blackmagic Design](Blackmagic_Design.html "Blackmagic Design"), [AJA](AJA.html "AJA") and [Deltacast](Deltacast.html "Deltacast").

If the device does not seem to provide a video stream but it is visible in the Cameras parameter menu, make sure no other applications are currently using the device.

**TIP**: Create an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") and point it to the Video Device In TOP to see what devices are currently attached. The [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") gives data for analyzing the performance of Video Device In and Out TOPs. Additionally, the [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") can be used to obtain timecode embeded into the source signal on some device, as indicated in the below list.

Major capture devices vendors currently supported:

* [Blackmagic Design](Blackmagic_Design.html "Blackmagic Design") - Supports Timecode.
* [AJA](AJA.html "AJA") - Supports Timecode.
* [Deltacast](Deltacast.html "Deltacast") - Supports Timecode.
* [Bluefish444](Bluefish444.html "Bluefish444")

AJA and Blackmagic Design devices now support 12-bit input and output formats, including AJA’s ability to capture at a full 12-bit RGB 4:4:4. Furthermore, 10-bit input and output have received performance improvements and better support for a wider selection of firmware.

Also supported with native drivers are some models from Datapath SDI, Allied Vision, Imaging Development Systems (IDS), FLIR/Point Grey, and Ximea.

For Magewell HDMI-to-USB3 capture (highly recommended, no drivers, plug-and-play), see [Magewell](http://www.magewell.com/usb-capture-hdmi).

**IP Cameras** include models from [Allied Vision](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/cameras.html) (PvAPI SDK models only, not Vimba SDK), [Point Grey FLIR Flycapture2 and Spinnaker](https://www.ptgrey.com/) and [Imaging Development Systems (IDS)](https://en.ids-imaging.com/). In case of IDS's Cameras, TouchDesigner implements the *uEye IDS Software Suite*. *GigE Vision* cameras are currently not supported.

**USB3 Cameras** include models from [Allied Vision](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/cameras.html) (PvAPI SDK models only, not Vimba SDK), [Point Grey FLIR Flycapture2 and Spinnaker](https://www.ptgrey.com/) and [Imaging Development Systems (IDS)](https://en.ids-imaging.com/)

Only a small subset of cameras from each manufacturer has been tested in-house, however it's expected that any modern camera from the supported manufacturer should work. If any issues are encountered please contact `support@derivative.ca`.

## Parameters - Video In Page

Active `active` - When set to one the TOP captures the image stream from the camera or decoder.
Driver `driver` - ⊞ - Selects the library to use to interface with the cameras.

* DirectShow (WDM) `directshow` -

* Media Foundation `mediafoundation` -

* Imaging Source - Not Supported `imagingsource` -

* Allied Vision (GigE) `alliedvisiongige` -

* Imaging Development Systems (IDS) `ids` -

* FLIR / Point Grey (FlyCapture2) `pointgreyflycapture` -

* FLIR / Point Grey (Spinnaker) `flirspinnaker` -

* AVFoundation (macOS) `avfoundation` -

* BlueFish444 `bluefish444` -

* Ximea `ximea` -

Device `device` - ⊞ - Select which camera or decoder you want from this menu.

* NDI Webcam Video 1 `V1` -

Specify IP `specifyip` - When using Allied Vision library allows you to specify the camera address by IP.
IP `ip` - The IP address used when Specify IP above is turned on.
Options `options` - Opens the options or control panel for the camera. NOTE: Only works when using DirectShow (WDM) cameras.
Deinterlace `deinterlace` - ⊞ - Sets which fields to capture.

* Off `off` - Captures all fields.

* Even `even` - Capture Even fields only.

* Odd `odd` - Captures Odd fields only.

* Bob (Split) `bob` - Alternatively shows the even then odd fields, resulting in twice the framerate being shown, and removing the interlacing artifacts.

Field Precedence `precedence` - ⊞ - When using Bob (Split) deinterlacing, this selects which field is shown first for each frame.

TV Channel `channel` - Selects the TV channel if a TV tuner is used as the video input.
Signal Format `signalformat` - The signal format to capture input at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.
Quad Link `quadlink` - Used for cards that support quad-link formats. Quad-link esstenially takes 4 inputs and creates one single larger input out of them, for example 4 1080p inputs become a single 4K input.
Input Pixel Format `inputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Some capture devices support pixel formats other than 8-bit. For supported devices (Blackmagic Design) this will make the node attempt to use that capability.

* 8-bit `fixed8` - 8-bit per channel precision.

* 10-bit `fixed10` - 10-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGB10A2.

* 16-bit `fixed16` - 16-bit per channel precision. The texture pixel format will be set to RGBA16-Fixed.

* 12-bit `fixed12` -

Transfer Mode `transfermode` - ⊞ - Controls how the frames are transferred from the input device to CPU memory, and how they are transferred from CPU memory to the GPU.

* Automatic `automatic` - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. In general this will be 'Pre-Upload'.

* Pre-Upload `preupload` - Upload the frames to the GPU as they arrived. This ensures the data is already in GPU memory when the GPU wants to process it.

* On-Demand `ondemand` - Only upload frames to the GPU if the TOP is going to display them for that cook. This reduces PCIe bandwidth between the GPU and CPU memory in cases where the TOP is showing less frames than what the input device is capturing. However this means the GPU may stall waiting for that frame to be uploaded.

* On-Demand, Sync to Frame Input `ondemandsync` - This mode is currently only available for [AJA](AJA.html "AJA") devices. This causes the whole TouchDesigner process to stall until right after a frame arrives on this input. Then the process will start executing and use that input frame for this nodes cook. This removes any latency from the capture input, but can result in worse performance. Real-time should turned off for the TouchDesigner process at the top of the UI, and only one node should be set to this mode in a single process.

Memory Mode `memorymode` - ⊞ - Controls the memory type used to transfer data between the capture card and the GPU.

* Automatic `automatic` - Will choose the best memory mode for the transfer. This will be 'Pinned' for capture cards that support it, and 'Regular' if not.

* Pinned `pinned` - Pinned memory allows data to be transferred in 2 copies instead of three. Capture->Pinned CPU Memory, Pinned CPU Memory->GPU Memory.

* Regular `regular` - The regular memory mode means 3 copies are required. Capture->Capture Writable Memory, Capture Writable Memory->GPU Readable Memory, GPU Readable Memory->GPU Memory.

Sync Inputs `syncinputs` - Enabling syncing of multiple Video Device In TOPs. Syncing allows multiple nodes using multiple inputs and capture cards on a single system to ensure they are outputting frames in sync. Without this each node will be free running and will possible be outputting frames that came it at different times due to internal queuing. It's important the input sources are GenLocked to ensure all of their data arrives to all of the inputs at the same time, otherwise syncing will not work. This feature is currently supported for Blackmagic, DataPath, Deltacast and BlueFish devices.
Sync Group Index `syncgroupindex` - There can be multiple sync groups active in a .toe file. Nodes will only sync to other nodes that are part of the same sync group.
Max Sync Offset (ms) `maxsyncoffset` - Specified in milliseconds. The maximum difference in time two image could have arrived at be considered in-sync. Images that arrive at times more different than this offset will be considered to be part of different 'frame'.
Sync Timeout (ms) `synctimeout` - How much time to wait for all frames in a sync group to become available before giving up trying to sync. Expressed in milliseconds. If this timeout elapses when waiting for a frame from one or more sources in the sync group, all of the nodes in the sync group will keep their current image and not output a new image, even if some new images arrived on some of the inputs.
Reset Stats `resetstats` - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Currently all of these options are only available for [Ximea](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Ximea&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ximea (page does not exist)") cameras.

Extra Information for the Video Device In TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific Video Device In TOP Info Channels

* connected - 1 if the node is successfully connected to the device, 0 if not. This does not necessarily mean there is valid input coming to the device.

* sync\_timeouts - When using the 'Sync Group' feature, this counts how many times the group failed to all provide a frame with similar enough timestamps within the timeout period.

* last\_sync\_wait - How long the node had to wait from the time it was ready for a new frame until all the inputs provided valid frames for a synced output.

* odd\_field - When de-interlacing an interlaced input, this will be 1 when the odd field is being shown and 0 when the even field is being shown.

* capture\_fps - The calculated number of frames per second that are being captured by the device. This does **not** map directly to the signal format rate. It won't show 59.97 for example. This is simply a count of how many frames were captured in the last 1000ms.

* capture\_total - The total number of frames that have been captured this capture began.

* frames\_repeated - How many times the node has shown the same frame more than once. It does not currently correct for if the repeats are expected, such as when capturing a 30hz signal but TouchDesigner is running at 60fps. In that case the channel will keep increasing since each captured frame will be shown twice.

* frames\_dropped - This counts how many frames were captured by the card, but never consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thrad. This occurs if the capture is running faster than TouchDesigner is able to consume frames.

* frames\_skipped - This counts how many frames were consumed by TouchDesigner's reading thread, but never consumed by the node itself. This can occur if TouchDesigner isn't running at full frame rate.

* connection\_changes - Counts connection changes, not supported by all devices.

* temperature - On supported devices, outputs the temperature of the device in celsius. Will be a very negative number for devices that don't support it.

* signal\_fps - The actual signal format FPS of the input signal. 0 if unknown.

* rgb\_input - Will be 1 if the input is detected as an RGB (such as RGB 4:4:4 colorspace) format. 0 if it is a YUV based colorspace. -1 if it is unknown or not supported by the the library.

* frame\_queue\_length - The number of receieved frames queued inside TouchDesigner.

* frame\_hw\_queue\_length - The number of frames still queued on the device that TouchDesigner has not yet read.

* last\_dma\_copy\_time - The number of milliseconds it took to copy the last frame from the device to the CPU. -1 if this is not measured.

* frame\_timestamp - Time in seconds of the last frame displayed. -1 if this is not provided by the device.

## Parameters - Device Out Page

Active `active` - Enable or disable the output card.
Library `library` - ⊞ - Select the driver library to use.

* Blackmagic `blackmagic` - Supports driver version 12.x

Device `device` - ⊞ - A menu of available video devices to output to. Set the Library parameter above prior to selecting your device.

* DeckLink 8K Pro (1) `V1` -

Signal Format `signalformat` - The signal format to output at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.
Output Pixel Format `outputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Set the pixel format of the output when possible (depends what type of device is used). Data may be converted to YUV colorspace depending on what the device and settings require.

* 8-bit RGB `fixed8` - 8-bit color data, no alpha channel.

* 8-bit + 8-bit Key (Alpha) `fixed8key8` - 8-bit color data and 8-bit alpha. This usually means SDI cables where one cable will be the color data and one cable will be the alpha data.

* 10-bit RGB `fixed10` - 10-bit color data, no alpha.

Output Color Space `outputcolorspace` - ⊞ - Set the color space of the data sent out, for supported devices.

* `yuv422` - YUV 4:2:2. This is the most common color space to send data over SDI wires. It requires lower bandwidth than RGB 4:4:4, but results in some information loss.

* `rgb444` - RGB 4:4:4. This is RGB values taken directly from the TOP without any colorspace conversion (except for possibly pixel format). This requires more bandwidth but doesn't suffer from the information loss that YUV 4:2:2 has.

Audio CHOP `chop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") CHOP here.
Reference Source `referencesource` - ⊞ - On AJA devices what input to use as a reference source input.

* External Ref In `external` -

* SDI Input 1 `sdi1` -

* SDI Input 2 `sdi2` -

* SDI Input 3 `sdi3` -

* SDI Input 4 `sdi4` -

* SDI Input 5 `sdi5` -

* SDI Input 6 `sdi6` -

* SDI Input 7 `sdi7` -

* SDI Input 8 `sdi8` -

Audio CHOP `audiochop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") CHOP here.
Buffer Length `bufferlength` - The length in seconds to buffer the audio data, to avoid crackles and pops.
Audio Bit Depth `audiobitdepth` - ⊞ - Describes the number of bits of information used for each sample.

* 16-Bit `16bit` -

* 32-Bit `32bit` -

Manual Field Control `manualfield` - When outputting interlaced video if you are using a source video that is also interlaced, it's likely you'll want to make sure you are keeping the odd/even fields in sync, otherwise the video will look stuttery. You can use the 'odd\_field' value in the [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") on the [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP") or [Video Device In TOP](Video_Device_In_TOP.html "Video Device In TOP") to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd\_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In TOP, so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.
First Field `firstfield` - Tells the Video Device Out TOP if the current frame being given as it's input is the First or Second field in the final output image, when outputting an interlaced video. Look at the description for Manual Field Control for more information.
Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - Embed timecode into the output. A reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") object.
Transfer Mode `transfermode` - ⊞ - Controls how the image data is transfered between the GPU and the output card.

* Automatic `automatic` - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. It will choose 'Pinned' when possible, since that is the best performance.

* Default `default` - Transfer will be done in 3 stages. GPU to CPU memory. CPU memory to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.

* Pinned `pinned` - Transfer will be done in 2 stages. GPU to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.

Sync Outputs `syncoutputs` - Only currently supported on the [Deltacast](Deltacast.html "Deltacast") FLEX line of cards. This will cause multiple FLEX cards to output their content in sync with each other.
Sync Group Index `syncgroupindex` - For different groups of cards, they can be ganged together into different sync groups by specifying the same index for multiple cards in the same group.
Reset Stats `resetstats` - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Extra Information for the Video Device Out TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Specific Video Device Out TOP Info Channels

* connected - 1 if the device is connected/active, 0 if not.

* play\_speed - The play speed of the audio data. 1 if it's playing at normal speed, it'll be slightly faster or slower if it's needing to adjust the queue size to hit the target size.

* dropped\_frames - The number of frames drops from the output. These are frames that the output failed to provide new data for. If TD is running lower than the framerate the signal format is running at, this value should be increasing.

* skipped\_frames - These are frames that TD produced, but didn't get consumed by the output. This can be caused by the PCIe bandwidth (or the device) running slower than what is required for the data throughput/framerate.

* late\_frames - These are frames that were delivered to the card in time, but ended up getting shown later than expected. Usually only tracked on Blackmagic devices.

* frame\_queue\_length - The number of video frames queued in software for output.

* frame\_hw\_queue\_length - The number of video frames queued in the device hardware for output.

* audio\_sw\_buffer\_length - The length of the audio buffer (in seconds) in software.

* audio\_hw\_buffer\_length - The length of the audio buffer (in seconds) in the device hardware.

* genlocked - 1 if the card is known to be genlocked to an input, 0 if is card is not. -1 if it's not known.

* last\_dma\_copy\_time - The amount of time (in milliseconds) the last copy from the driver memory to the device took. -1 if it's not measured by this device type.

Video Stream In TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Video Stream In TOP

The Video Stream In TOP creates a client to receive video and audio across the network from RTSP, HLS, or SRT sources; or from a WebRTC peer via a WebRTC DAT.

The URL to connect to a RTSP server is in the form:

`rtsp://<ipaddress>:<port>/<streamName>` for example `rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/tdvidstream`

If the server requires a username/password, those can be specified using the form.

`rtsp://username:password@192.168.0.1:554/tdvidstream`

Access **[HLS/DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)** input streams via URLs that point to m3u8 files.

Access streams using **[SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Reliable_Transport)** protocol with `srt://` URLs. For more information on SRT URLs, please see [Video Stream Out TOP](Video_Stream_Out_TOP.html "Video Stream Out TOP").

See also [Audio Stream In CHOP](Audio_Stream_In_CHOP.html "Audio Stream In CHOP"), [WebRTC DAT](WebRTC_DAT.html "WebRTC DAT").

SRT sent in the Video Stream In TOP can include per-frame metadata making it easy to send and receive CHOP/DAT data in sync with video. Attach an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") to the TOP.

For other protocols over IP see [NDI (Network Data Interface)](NDI.html "NDI"), and [Touch Out TOP](Touch_Out_TOP.html "Touch Out TOP") / [Touch In TOP](Touch_In_TOP.html "Touch In TOP").

  + [7.3 Common Operator Info Channels](#Common_Operator_Info_Channels)

Active `active` - When set to one, the TOP captures the image stream from the specified url.
Mode `mode` - ⊞ - Select the mode: either a Server (for RTSP, HLS or SRT URLs), or WebRTC.

* Server `server` - Use a RTSP, HLS, or SRT server source.

* WebRTC `webrtc` - Use a WebRTC peer as a source.

Server URL `url` - The URL (address) of the stream, see summary above for specific details.
Reload `reload` - Reload the stream by attempting to reconnect.
Reload Pulse `reloadpulse` - Triggers the Reload immediately on release (button-up). This can be accessed in python using the pulse() method.
Play `play` - The stream will play forward when Play = On, it will be paused when Off.

Deinterlace `deinterlace` - ⊞ - For movies that are stored as fields, where each image is made of two images interleaved together. A 30-frame per second movie would contain 60 fields per second. For each image, the even scanlines of the first field are interleaved with the odd scanlines of the second field. The Video Stream In TOP has several ways of dealing with this:

* Off `off` - Output the images unchanged.

* Odd `odd` - Take only the odd scanlines of the file's images and create the even scanlines by interpolating between the odd scanlines.

* Bob (Split) `bob` - This produces 60 images per second for a 30 frame-per-second movie file. It first outputs the even image (as in Even above) followed by the Odd image. This has the best time-smoothness.

Bottom Half is Alpha (AAA) `bottomhalfalpha` - This is a way of encoding alpha into RGB-only formats like H.264. and several other QuickTime formats. You need to create your movies so that the bottom half of the image is the alpha (RGB = AAA). Turning on this features tells the Video Stream In TOP to take the bottom half of the image and put it into the alpha channel of the output. The image height will be cut in half.

Pre-Read Frames `prereadframes` - Sets how many video frames TouchDesigner reads ahead and stores in memory. Using this, smooth reading of an image stream is possible even when the disk files are fragmented. The Movie File In TOP will read frames of the movie into memory before they are used, this can eliminate pops or stutters in playback that occur from fragmented files, other resources accessing the hard drive, or movie looping.
Max Decode CPUs `maxdecodecpus` - Limit the maximum number of CPUs that will be used to decode certain codecs that are capable of multi-CPU decoding, such as H264.
Network Buffer Size (KB) `networkbuffersize` - Specify the size of the network input buffer in kilobytes.
Network Queue Size (4KB Each) `networkqueuesize` - Specify the number of 4KB chunks to assign to the network queue. This is data stored after being read off of the network input buffer.
Disable Buffering `disablebuffering` -
Hardware Decode `hwdecode` - Enables hardware decoding on Nvidia GPUs.

Extra Information for the Video Stream In TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Video Stream Out TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Video Stream Out TOP

**Note:** This TOP uses the Nvidia Hardware Encoder to create the stream and therefore requires an Nvidia GPU and Windows to operate.

The Video Stream Out TOP creates either an [RTSP](RTSP.html "RTSP") server, or can act as an [RTMP](RTMP.html "RTMP") or [SRT](SRT.html "SRT") sender, to send H.264 video and MP3 audio across the network. It uses Nvidia's hardware H264 encoder. For RTSP, it can handle multiple clients connecting to it at the same time. Multiple Video Stream Out TOPs using the same port will be handled using the same underlying RTSP server. The Video Stream Out TOP can also be used to send a video stream through [WebRTC](WebRTC.html "WebRTC") video/audio tracks.

##### RTSP

Obtain the URL to connect to the Video Steam Out TOP's RTSP server by using an Info DAT or by middle clicking on the node. It will be in the form:

`rtsp://<ipaddress>:<port>/<streamName>`

e.g.

`rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/tdvidstream`

##### RTMP

To obtain the RTMP URL stream to, you may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using. This should be in the format:

`{service url}/{stream key}`.

For example for Twitch the URL would be something like

`rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY`

For more information on different services see [RTMP](RTMP.html "RTMP").

##### SRT

[SRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Reliable_Transport) can use either H.264 or H.265 video codec. It can also send per-frame metadata when a CHOP or DAT is specified in the Per-Frame Metadata parameter. The SRT server is settings are controlled by URL options. E.g to create a listener you'd specify the URL:

`srt://0.0.0.0:9494?mode=listener`

To connect to listener, you'd do:

`srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller`

Either side of the connection can be the listener or the caller, it doesn't matter which is sending the video and which is receiving the video. The receiver would set their mode to be the opposite of whatever the sender is setting their mode to be.

All the options that are available are listed [here](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#srt). Multiple options can be set using a & as separator. E.g

`srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller&send_buffer_size=100000`

SRT sent from the Video Stream Out TOP can include per-frame metadata making it easy to send and receive CHOP/DAT data in sync with video. It can be read with the [Video Stream In TOP](Video_Stream_In_TOP.html "Video Stream In TOP").

##### Limitations

RTSP streaming does not support sending directly to another RTSP server via RTP.

The maximum stream outs on a NVIDIA Geforce card is 2: The number of streams the GPU can handle is different depending on driver versions and hardware, however in general it is 2 streams max on Geforce level cards. Using a lower resolution does not avoid the 2 stream limit. Quadros can do more streams. Refer to [Nvidia Video GPU Support Matrix](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new) for more information.

One test using the default TouchDesigner startup file on a M6000 was able to do 13 1080p@30hz Video Stream Out TOPs.

Multi-Cast `multicast` - Controls if RTSP server sends its video out using unicast or multicast UDP packets.
RTMP Destination URL `url` - The URL to sent the RTMP stream to. This should be in the format of {service url}/{stream key}. For example for twitch the URL would be something like `rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY`. You may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using.
Destination URL `url` - The URL to sent the RTMP stream to. This should be in the format of {service url}/{stream key}. For example for twitch the URL would be something like `rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY`. You may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using.
Force IDR `forceidr` - For debugging, this will force the server to create a new video keyframe to send to all the clients. If clients aren't getting proper image this can be used to attempt to fix it. If you need to use this parameter please report the case to support@derivative.ca.
FPS `fps` - The FPS to send video at.

Max B-Frames `maxbframes` - The maximum number of bi-directional frames that can occur between keyframes. More will increase latency but reduce bandwidth.
Intra-Refresh Period `intrarefreshperiod` - Intra-refresh is a gradual keyframe that is applied across the image to clean up streaming artifacts over multiple frames, instead of one large keyframe. This controls the number of frames that elapse between each intra-refresh occuring.
Intra-Refresh Length `intrarefreshlength` - The number of frames the intra-refresh will be spread out across.
Bitrate Mode `bitratemode` - ⊞ - Chooses between constant (CBR) and variable (VBR) bit rate modes. Mode streaming services prefer a constant bit rate mode.

Average Bitrate (Mb/s) `avgbitrate` - The target bitrate for the encoding. This is specified in Mb/s (megabits/second).
Per-Frame Metadata `perframemetadata` - Send metadata from this OP with each frame of the video stream. This data can be received from the [Video Stream In TOP](Video_Stream_In_TOP.html "Video Stream In TOP") using an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") and [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT").
Max Bitrate (Mb/s) `maxbitrate` - The maximum bitrate for the encoding. This is specified in Mb/s (megabits/second).
Num H264 Slices per Frame `numslices` - This controls how many pieces (slices) each H.264 frame is separated into. Some decoders are able to decode multiple slices simultaneously so setting this to a value above 1 allows those decoders to run more efficiently.

Warp CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Warp CHOP

The Warp CHOP time-warps the channels of the first input (the Pre-Warp Channels) using one warping channel in the second input (the Warp Curve). The Warp Curve acts as either a rate control or an index control, as explained below. The Warp CHOP usually works on non-time-sliced channels, like pre-key-framed channels of motion. See also the [Lookup CHOP](Lookup_CHOP.html "Lookup CHOP"), the [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP") and the [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP").

In the Rate Control Method, feeding the Warp CHOP a Warp Curve with a constant value of 1 makes the output identical to the Pre-Warp Channels, assuming the two inputs have the same start-end interval. That is, where the rate is 1, the Pre-Warp Channels are not warped.

Where the Warp Curve is above 1, it causes a speed-up in the animation. Where the Warp Curve is below 1, it causes a slow-down in the animation. Rates less than 0 cause the animation to go in reverse.

In the Index Control Method, the Warp Curve acts as an index into the first input. If the Warp Curve is a straight ramp with a slope of 1 (in Units), it produces unwarped output channels. If Units is set to Seconds, a Warp Curve value of 0 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 0 seconds. A Warp Curve value of 2 gets the Pre-Warp Channels' values at time 2 seconds.

The Warp CHOP will output the same number of channels and channel names as the Pre-Warp Channels input, and the sample rate will be the same as that of the Pre-Warp input. However, the CHOP will output the same start-end time interval as the Warp Curve input.

If you take a Warp Curve and pass it directly to a Warp CHOP with the Rate Control Method, it is equivalent to passing the same curve to an Speed CHOP and then passing it to the Warp CHOP with the Index Control Method.

## Parameters - Warp Page

Method `method` - ⊞ - The warping method to use: Rate or Index Control.

* Rate Control `rate` -

* Index Control `index` -

Stretch Indices to Channel Length `scaleindex` - If on, the minimum and maximum values in the Warp Curve are mapped to the beginning and end of the channels to be warped. Otherwise, the Warp Curve is applied as-is to the Pre-Warp Channels.

The Warp CHOP does linear interpolation of the Pre-Warped Channels when they are both stretched and compressed.

Wave CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Wave CHOP

The Wave CHOP makes repeating waves with a variety of shapes. It is by default 10-seconds of 1-second sine waves, a total of 600 frames. You can adjust period (frequency), phase, shape, amplitude and offset.

The Wave CHOP gives a set of waves in channels of a specifiable time-range. It is superceded by the [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html "LFO CHOP") which gives an endless stream of waves that is [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)"), and the [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP") that has more control over shaping waveform samples (and is time-independent). The [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP") also creates waveforms that are continually repeated, but its defaults are for higher-frequency waves at higher (audio) sample rates.

Because the Extend Conditions of the Wave CHOP are set to Repeat, the wave will repeat outside the 10-second range.

Applied to the actual waveform can be an offset, decay and ramp.

Multiple channels can be generated in the Channel Name parameter using [Pattern Expansion](Pattern_Expansion.html "Pattern Expansion"). A few examples of name pattern name expansion:

* `tx ty tz`
* `t[xyz]` - expands to `tx ty tz`
* `chan[1-4]` - expands to `chan1 chan2 chan3 chan4`
* `c[xyz][1-5:2]` - expands to `cx1 cx3 cx5 cy1 cy3 cy5 cz1 cz3 cz5`

See also: [LFO CHOP](LFO_CHOP.html "LFO CHOP"), [Pattern CHOP](Pattern_CHOP.html "Pattern CHOP"), [Audio Oscillator CHOP](Audio_Oscillator_CHOP.html "Audio Oscillator CHOP").

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[waveCHOP\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/WaveCHOP_Class "WaveCHOP Class")

## Parameters - Wave Page

Type `wavetype` - ⊞ - There is a choice of waveforms shapes:

* Constant `const` - [![TouchChannels69.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/6/6c/TouchChannels69.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels69.gif)(1) A constant-valued "wave".

* Pulse `pulse` - [![TouchChannels82.gif](https://docs.derivative.ca/images/c/c4/TouchChannels82.gif)](https://docs.derivative.ca/File:TouchChannels82.gif)(0 to 1) Produces a 1 for one sample, 0 otherwise.

* Expression `expr` - A user defined expression.

The Sine formula is:

```
out = Amplitude * (Offset + sin ((Period*index - Phase)*360))

Period `period` - The period is the number of seconds, frames or samples that the waveform repeats in. It is expressed in the chop's Units (default is Seconds), found on the Common page.
Period Unit `periodunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Phase `phase` - The phase shifts the waveform in time, and is expressed as a fraction of a period, usually between 0 and 1.
Bias `bias` - You can vary the shape of some of the waveform types by changing the bias within the range -1 to +1.
Offset `offset` - The waveform's value can be offset. A sine wave can remain always positive by setting Offset to 1.
Amplitude `amp` - The wave's value can be scaled.
Decay Rate `decay` - The wave's amplitude can be reduced over time with an "exponential decay". For example, if the Decay is 0.2 and the Units are seconds, then the amplitude will decay to 0.8 after 1 second, and 0.8 of 0.8 (or 0.64) after 2 seconds.
Decay Rate Unit `decayunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Ramp Slope `ramp` - Then a ramp is added to the result with a slope of Ramp. The channel increases by the Ramp Slope value every Unit of time. For example, if Ramp is 1.2, the channel increases by 1.2 every second, in addition to the shape of the wave.
Ramp Slope Unit `rampunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Expression `exprs` - If the waveform type is Expression, the Expression parameter is used to input a math expression. Some local variables are available: $I (Index), $L (the loop variable over the period 0 to 1), $C (the cycle variable, the integer number of cycles the waveform has passed at the current index).

Channel Names `channelname` - You can creates many channels with simple patterns like "`chan[1-20]`", which generates 20 channels from chan1 to chan20. See the section, Common CHOP Parameters for a description of this and all Options. See [Scope and Channel Name Matching](CHOP_Common_Page.html#Scope "CHOP Common Page") Options.
Start `start` - Start of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples).
Start Unit `startunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
End `end` - End of the interval, expressed in Units (seconds, frames or samples).
End Unit `endunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Sample Rate `rate` - The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.
Extend Left `left` - ⊞ - The left extend conditions (before/after range).

Extra Information for the Wave CHOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Web Client DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Web Client DAT

The Web Client DAT allows you to send HTTP requests to web servers from TouchDesigner. It supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS and PATCH http methods.

The Web Client DAT supports various authentication types such as: basic, oauth1, oauth2.

The Web Client DAT allows for streaming from web servers.

The Web Client DAT sends HTTP requests to web servers and then outputs the response in the DAT. With streaming enabled it can stream data from a web server.

When streaming is enabled, Clamp Output as Rows should be enabled. This turns the output of the DAT into a FIFO table instead of raw text. Only the last N lines will be displayed, where N is the value of the Maximum Lines parameter. This will prevent the text in the DAT from getting too larger and will keep cook-times down as a result.

The Web Client DAT supports sending of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, and PATCH request methods. The Web Client DAT also supports 4 authentication methods: Basic, Digest, OAuth1, and OAuth2.

The first input is the extra headers to send in the request. It should be a table with 2 columns, structured as name/value pairs. For example:

| Content-Type | application/json |
| --- | --- |
| Connection | Close |

The second input is the data/parameters to send in the request. This can be a table with two columns, structured as name/value pairs. It can also just be text, in which case it will be sent as is. If the request method doesn't have a request body (eg. GET, OPTIONS) then it will append the input to the URL as query parameters if a table, otherwise it will be sent as the request data.

| name | joe |
| --- | --- |
| month | May |

The Web Client DAT is the successor to the [Web DAT](Web_DAT.html "Web DAT").

Web DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Web DAT

**Note**: Web DAT deprecated build 2019.15230, use [Web Client DAT](Web_Client_DAT.html "Web Client DAT").

```
   The Web DAT fetches pages of data from a web connection. The data should be ASCII-readable. The Web DAT will automatically uncompress any gzip compressed page transfers. XML content is formatted into a readable indented structure, versus one long line normally sent by the server. An Info DAT can be used to obtain properties of the last page retrieved.

There are two main methods of retrieving a page from a web site using the Web DAT:

* Fetch
* Submit and Fetch

The Fetch method simply fetches the page from the internet using the simple protocol "GET", while the Submit and Fetch method can be used for submitting form data to a server. By default the latter method uses the "POST" protocol.

Both methods allow a DAT table input to specify options while fetching. This table should consist of rows of name/value pairs. The first column consists of the names, while the second column consists of the values. The Fetch method simply concatenates the pairs into the specified URL, while the Update and Fetch method posts the pairs to a webserver, before fetching the resulting page.

For example, assume a table with the following contents is connected to the Web DAT:

If the specified URL is:
*[http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)*

Then the Fetch method will actually fetch:
*[http://www.example.com?name=joe&month=May](http://www.example.com/?name=joe&month=May)*

Similarly, the Submit and Fetch method will post the pairs to the specified webserver, before fetching the page.

Note that spaces and other special characters in the table will be properly encoded. For example, each space in a name or value would be encoded as: %20

The first input can also be text data, in which case the data is sent to the webserver during a POST as-is, without any formatting or encoding. If the first input is text it will be ignored during a GET operation.

The 2nd input of the Web DAT can be used for custom HTTP request headers to be specified as part of the request. Like the 1st input this should be a table of name/value pairs for header field name and the value. E.g

| Content-Type | application/json |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Tue, 12 Nov 2013 08:12:31 GMT |

Each row will automatically be merged into a single line of text separated by a colon. If the 2nd column is empty then the entry in the first column will have a semi-color append to it when it's turned into the request header.

* [1 Summary](#Summary)
* [2 Parameters - Fetch Page](#Parameters_-_Fetch_Page)
* [3 Parameters - Common Page](#Parameters_-_Common_Page)
* [4 Operator Inputs](#Operator_Inputs)

## Parameters - Fetch Page

URL `url` - The url address of the web page to be retrieved.
Fetch `fetch` - The data will be fetched when this button is pressed. Use this method to retrieve simple single pages from the internet. By default the Web DAT will stall the process until the whole page has been transferred, or an error occurs. You can do asynchronous downloads using the Asynchronous Fetch option.
Submit Method `method` - ⊞ - Currently only POST is implemented, though this will be expanded with other techniques such as GET.

* POST `post` -

Submit and Fetch `submitfetch` - Post all the name/value pairs from the input DAT to the server, then fetch the page specified in the URL parameter.

Use this method to post data to a web server before retrieving the page. The data to be sent is in the form of name and value pairs. It can be specified with a table formatted DAT connected to the first input, where the first column represents data names, and the second column represents data values. The Web DAT will pause until the whole page has been transferred, or an error occurs.

Include Header in Output `includeheader` - Includes the HTTP header in the output.
Timeout `timeout` - If this value is 0 the fetch request will never timeout. Any other value is how many milliseconds before the fetch times out.
Disconnect `disconnect` - Closes the session.
Asynchronous Fetch `asyncfetch` - Turn on this option to allow the download to occur in the background. You can use a [DAT Execute DAT](DAT_Execute_DAT.html "DAT Execute DAT") to do something when the data finally arrives.
Verify Peer Certificate `verifypeer` - Enables TLS (transport layer security) certificate verification.

Web Render TOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Web Render TOP

The Web Render TOP takes a URL or DAT and renders a webpage via a separate browser process that uses Chromium Embedded Frameworks, and passes the result back through shared memory. It renders non-Flash pages, including HTML, HTML5, PDF, SVG and more. Targets can be on the internet, in local files with a `file://` syntax, or a [DAT](DAT.html "DAT").

It is implemented with the [Chromium Embedded Frameworks](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef) project (CEF).

Attach an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") to get the loaded status `loaded` of the page, and `num_handle_updates`, the number of times the page has been rendered.

Attach an [Info DAT](Info_DAT.html "Info DAT") to get the shared memory `handle`, the `status` of the browser process, the `process_id`, versions for Chromium Embedded Frameworks `cef` and Chromium `chromium`, the `url` currently displayed, page `title` and `error` state of the process.

# Web Server DAT

The Web Server DAT allows you to connect to TouchDesigner as a web client, through a web browser for example. The Web Server DAT supports HTTP, WebSockets, as well as the sending/receiving of binary data, such as images (uploading/downloading). How client requests are handled is left up to the user via callbacks.

The Web Server DAT can be secure, and also supports basic authentication via the authenticateBasic in the [webserverDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/WebserverDAT_Class "WebserverDAT Class"). Currently only Basic authentication (ie. encoded username and password) is supported via a python method. Authentication will be in the HTTP request dictionary under the key 'Authorization'.

Ultimately, security is the complete responsibility of the user. It is up to the user to ensure that HTTP requests are properly authenticated, and any data storing usernames/passwords are encrypted or saved privately.

HTTPS is supported via the Secure (TLS) parameter.

The Web Server DAT is built with [POCO](https://github.com/pocoproject/poco) v1.9.1.

## Parameters - Web Server Page

Active `active` - Starts and Stops the webserver.
Restart `restart` - When the server is active, pulsing will restart it.
Port `port` - The web server's connection port. Eg. If the port number is 9980, the web server can be connected to locally (via a web browser) at the address "localhost:9980".
Secure (TLS) `secure` - When enabled, the web server will use transport layer security (TLS) to create secure connections with clients. As a result, the web server will run through HTTPS instead of HTTP.
Private Key File Path `privatekey` - The path to the private key file of the server's TLS certificate.
Certificate File Path `certificate` - The path to the certificate file of the server's TLS certificate.
Certificate Password `password` - The password for the certificate specified above. The password is only visually hidden and can still be accessed via python. In order to protect it and encrypt it when the project is saved, the Web Server DAT should be put in a private component.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - A reference to a DAT with python callbacks. The Web Server DAT relies heavily on the Callbacks DAT, and in fact most functionality passes through the callbacks.

`onHTTPRequest` - Triggered when the web server receives an HTTP request. The request is a dictionary of HTTP headers. Similarly, response is a dictionary of response data such as status and reason. Additional key/value pairs can be added to the response dictionary that will be added as headers in the HTTP response. The response server must be returned from the callback. This response will be sent back to the client.

`onWebSocketOpen` - Triggered when a WebSocket connection is opened with a client. The client address is passed to the callback.

`onWebSocketClose` - Triggered when a WebSocket connection is closed. The client address is passed to the callback.

`onWebSocketReceiveText` - Triggered when the server's WebSocket connection receives text data from a client. The client that sent the text data is passed through to the callback.

WebRTC DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# WebRTC DAT

A WebRTC DAT represents a peer on one end of any number of [WebRTC](WebRTC.html "WebRTC") peer-to-peer connections.

Each connection is represented in TouchDesigner by a generated UUID. The UUID must be passed to [WebrtcDAT Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/WebrtcDAT_Class "WebrtcDAT Class") connection-level python methods.

The WebRTC DAT output is a table formatted with a row per connection, with columns: id (ie. UUID), [connection\_state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/connectionState), [signaling\_state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/signalingState), [ice\_connection\_state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/iceConnectionState), and [ice\_gathering\_state](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/iceGatheringState).

The columns altogether describe the state of a connection and can also be useful for debugging. For example, if ice\_connection\_state failed then that means there's an issue pairing local and remote ICE candidates for streaming over the network. It could be that NAT traversal failed, and if using a STUN server that might indicate a need for a TURN server (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN#Limitations>).

WebRTC video and audio input/output is done via the [Video Stream In TOP](Video_Stream_In_TOP.html "Video Stream In TOP"), [Video Stream Out TOP](Video_Stream_Out_TOP.html "Video Stream Out TOP"), [Audio Stream In CHOP](Audio_Stream_In_CHOP.html "Audio Stream In CHOP"), and [Audio Stream Out CHOP](Audio_Stream_Out_CHOP.html "Audio Stream Out CHOP").

WebSocket DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# WebSocket DAT

The WebSocket DAT receives and parses [WebSocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) messages. WebSockets are fast an efficient two way communication protocol used by web servers and clients. Each message is parsed and appended as a row in the DAT's table. The table is FIFO "first-in first-out" and limited to parameter-set number of lines. An optional script may be run for each packet received. Secure (tls) websocket servers are also supported.
Connections to different WebSocket sites are supported without requiring manual header setup.

The WebSocket DAT prints status and error messages to the TouchDesigner text console. The text console can be enabled by setting the environment variable TOUCH\_TEXT\_CONSOLE=1 (see: [https://docs.derivative.ca/Variables#System\_Environment\_Variables](Variables.html#System_Environment_Variables)). The text console will open the next time TouchDesigner is launched.

For SocketIO support see the [SocketIO DAT](SocketIO_DAT.html "SocketIO DAT").

See also: [TCP/IP DAT](TCP/IP_DAT.html "TCP/IP DAT")

Example project: [chat with WebSockets](http://www.derivative.ca/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=30301)

[![PythonIcon.png](images/c/c2/PythonIcon.png)](File_PythonIcon.html)[websocketDAT\_Class](https://docs.derivative.ca/WebsocketDAT_Class "WebsocketDAT Class")

Active `active` - While on, the DAT receives information sent to the network port. While Off, no updating occurs. Data sent to the port is lost.
Network Address `netaddress` - The network address of the server computer. This address is a standard WWW address, such as `foo` or `foo.bar.com`. You can put an IP address (e.g. `100.123.45.78`). If you put `localhost`, it means the other end of the connection is on the same computer.
Network Port `port` - The port in which the DAT will accept messages. Port 443 implies a secure connection. If attempting a secure connection not using port 443 then a "wss://" prefix is required on the Network Address parameter.
Connection Timeout `timeout` - Time in milliseconds the WebSocket DAT will wait to connect to the server.

Extra Information for the WebSocket DAT can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

Window COMP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# Window COMP

The Window Component allows you to create and maintain a separate floating or fixed window displaying the contents of any [Panel](Panel.html "Panel") or any [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer").

Most frequently you are setting up the Window COMP `/perform` in the default TouchDesigner project. `/perform` is the default window for [Perform Mode](Perform_Mode.html "Perform Mode"). In the Parameter dialog of the Window component you adjust its settings such as resolution, centering, and which monitor(s) the window will get displayed on.

You then press F1 to go into [Perform Mode](Perform_Mode.html "Perform Mode") and operate/display the panel standalone.

Press Esc over a window to close it and go back to [Designer Mode](Designer_Mode.html "Designer Mode").

You can create more Window Components, point them to panels or other Operators like TOPs, adjust their parameters and then pulse the parameter Open as Separate Window to see its effect.

Use the Dialog-> [Window Placement Dialog](Window_Placement_Dialog.html "Window Placement Dialog") which controls which window COMPs get displayed on startup. All Window COMPS in your project are listed there and you can test them individually.

A window can be fit to a single monitor, or span several monitors.

Attach an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") to the Window component - it will show you the window's current location and size, and whether the window is actually open.

See also [Window](Window.html "Window"), [Multiple Monitors](Multiple_Monitors.html "Multiple Monitors").

## Parameters - Window Page

Window Operator `winop` - Specifies the operator the window will display.
Title `title` - Specify the window's title.

---

Justisy and Offset to... `justifyoffsetto` - ⊞ - All the positioning parameters below are done relative to the location you specify here. Your window can span more than the specified 'area', it's just used as the reference for positioning. **Note for macOS**: When using 'Bounds of all Monitors' you must turn off the 'Displays have separate Spaces' toggle in System Preferences > Desktop & Dock > Mission Control, see [Multiple\_Monitors#macOS](Multiple_Monitors.html#macOS "Multiple Monitors") for details.

* Primary Monitor `primarymonitor` - The primary monitor which is sometimes referred to as the **main display** in Windows control panel or the **primary display** in the NVIDIA control panel.

* Specify Monitor `specifymonitor` - Defines the location to be the monitor specified in the Monitor parameter below.

* Bounds of All Monitors `allmonitors` - Defines the location to include all monitors. The TaskBar is ignored when using this option.

Ignore Taskbar `ignoretaskbar` - The Windows taskBar is ignored when this option is 'On'. When off the taskbar is accounted for so position and sizing will not cover it up.
Monitor `monitor` - Specify the monitor index when Area is set to **Single Monitor**.
Justify Horizontal `justifyh` - ⊞ - Aligns the window horizontally with the monitor or bounds of all monitors.

* Left `left` - Align window so that left edge coincides with left edge of specified area.

* Center `center` - Align window so that horizontal center coincides with horizontal center of specified area.

* Right `right` - Align window so that right edge coincides with right edge of specified area.

* Mouse `mouse` - Align window so it opens horizontally centered on the mouse cursor.

Justify Vertical `justifyv` - ⊞ - Aligns the window vertically with the monitor or bounds of all monitors.

* Top `top` - Align window so that top edge coincides with top edge of specified area.

* Center `center` - Align window so that vertical center coincides with vertical center of specified area.

* Bottom `bottom` - Align window so that bottom edge coincides with bottom edge of specified area.

* Mouse `mouse` - Align window so it opens vertically centered on the mouse cursor.

Offset `winoffset` - ⊞ - Horizontal offset applied to window after justifying.

* X `winoffsetx` - Horizontal offset applied to window after justifying.

* Y `winoffsety` - Vertical offset applied to window after justifying.

Shift to Single Monitor `single` - This menu has options for shifting the opening window. You can either shift to a single monitor or shift to the monitor the cursor is over when the window opens.

DPI Scaling `dpiscaling` - ⊞ - Options for managing DPI scaling on high DPI monitors. To inspect a monitor's DPI scaling setting, you can use the [Monitors DAT](Monitors_DAT.html "Monitors DAT") and refer to the `dpi_scale` column.

* Native `native` - Uses the full resolution of the monitor's native pixels, regardless of the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. ie Display Scale = 1.0

* Use DPI Scale `usedpiscale` - Uses the resolution set by the operating system's display scaling setting for that monitor. For example, a 3840x2160 monitor with display scaling set to 2.0 results in an addressable resolution of 1920x1080. On Windows system this would be a Display Scaling setting of 200%.

Opening Size `size` - ⊞ - Determines how the size of the window is determined.

* Automatic from Panel COMP/TOP `automatic` - Determines the size automatically from the size of the COMP/TOP specified.

* Fill Location `fill` - Fills the location specified in the Justify and Offset To... parameter above.

* Custom `custom` - Use the Width and Height parameters below to specify a custom size.

Width `winw` - The width of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.
Height `winh` - The height of the window when Opening Size parameter is set to Custom.
Update Settings from Window `update` - When the window is open you can reposition and resize it. Clicking this button will then read its current windows settings and apply them to the parameters above.

Borders `borders` - Controls whether or not the window contains borders and a title bar.
Include Borders in Size `bordersinsize` - When 'On' the borders are included in the size of the window.
Always on Top `alwaysontop` - Controls whether or not the window always sits atop other floating windows.
Cursor Visible `cursorvisible` - ⊞ - Controls whether or not the cursor remains visible when over this window.

* Never `nocursor` - The cursor is never visible over the window.

* When Moving `cursoronmove` - The cursor will only be visible when moving and for a short period after it stops moving.

* Always `alwaysvisible` - The cursor will always be visble when over the window.

Close on Escape Key `closeescape` - When 'On' pressing the escape key over this window will close it. **TIP**: Shift-Escape will always close it, whether this parameter is on or off.
Allow Viewer Interaction `interact` - Enables interactions with the operator specified in the Window Operator parameter.
Allow Minimize `allowminimize` - Enables the window to be minimized in the taskbar (dock in macOS).

V-Sync Mode `vsyncmode` - ⊞ - Controls how the window is updated with regards to V-Sync. Enabled means it will update in sync with the monitors refresh which avoids tearing and lost frames. Disabled means it can update at any point during the refresh which can result in tearing or lost frames. FPS is Half Monitor Rate should be used when doing things such as running a 30fps file on a 60Hz display. This makes each update be shown for exactly 2 refreshes which keeps motion looking smooth.

* Disabled `disabled` - Vertical Sync off.

* Enabled `enabled` - Vertical Sync on.

* FPS is Half Monitor Rate `halfmonitorrate` - This allows you to run your project at 30FPS on a 60Hz monitor, but ensuring every image is shown for exactly 2 refreshes. Without this option an image may be shown for 1 or 3 refreshes, which makes the content look like it is stuttering. Currently this feature is not functional in the 2022.20000+ series of builds, but we hope to bring back this feature when Vulkan adds support for it.

Draw Window `drawwindow` - When disabled the window will not update it's contents at all. Useful for processes that arn't doing rendering such as Audio or networking processes, or for when using VR devices.
Hardware Frame-Lock `hwframelock` - Provides multi-GPU frame-lock sync using [Nvidia Quadro Sync](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/solutions/quadro-sync/) and [AMD S400](http://www.amd.com/us/products/workstation/graphics/s400/Pages/s400.aspx) sync cards. For more information, see [Syncing Multiple Computers](Syncing_Multiple_Computers.html "Syncing Multiple Computers") and [Hardware Frame Lock](Hardware_Frame_Lock.html "Hardware Frame Lock").
OpenGL Stereo `openglstereo` - **No longer supported.** Turn 'On' when using openGL stereoscopic output.
Right Eye Operator `winrightop` - **No longer supported.** This parameter is enabled when the OpenGL Stereo parameter above is turned on. Specify the [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") used for the right eye here.

Open as Perform Window `performance` - Opens this Window COMP in [Perform Mode](Perform_Mode.html "Perform Mode"). Any Window COMP can be set as default Perform Window (opens using F1 shortcut) using the [Window Placement Dialog](Window_Placement_Dialog.html "Window Placement Dialog"). This button allows you to open this Window COMP in Perform Mode without changing what is currently selected as the 'default' Perform Window.
Open as Separate Window `winopen` - Opens this Window COMP as its own floating window, not as the Perform Window. Useful for things such as dialog boxes, popups, or testing, but should not be used for putting final rendered content to outputs. Use a single large Perform Window for that instead of separate windows.
Close `winclose` - Closes the window, if it's open.
Set as Perform Window `setperform` - Permanently changes the Perform Window setting in the Window Placement dialog to this window.
Window Placement Dialog `opendialog` - A shortcut to open the Window Placement dialog.
Include in Placement Dialog `includedialog` - When 'On' this Window COMP will be displayed in the Window Placement Dialog.

Extra Information for the Window COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

# WrnchAI CHOP

**Note: Wrnch has be acquired by another company and it is no longer possible to obtain a license to use it anymore. This CHOP has been removed in 2022.20000+ builds.**

Using the [wrnchAI](https://docs.derivative.ca/WrnchAI "WrnchAI") engine to track human motion in any video stream, this CHOP will output channels for Body, Face and Hand positions. Multiple people can be tracked at the same time with low-latency, and the system compatible with all cameras and video feeds. TouchDesigner used the wrnchAI Edge SDK and all computation is done locally in realtime utilizing Nvidia GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA® Deep Neural Network library ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)). This can offer skeletal tracking of multiple people at 60fps or higher (90-120fps etc).

```
Requires a separate license from wrnchAI to run in TouchDesigner. Requires Nvidia GPU on Windows OS and TouchDesigner Pro. 
Make sure to install TouchDesigner from the Full Installer, the Lite Installer does not include wrnchAI libraries.

##### Quickstart Guide

Once you have a wrnchAI license (purchased or trial), you will have access to your **wrnchAI licenses** page and the **wrnchAI Edge Releases** page.

1. Go to your [wrnchAI licenses page](https://devportal.wrnch.ai/licenses). Click on the 'key' icon and copy the **Edge License Key** into the CHOP's 'wrnchAI License' parameter.
2. Go to [wrnchAI Edge Releases page](https://devportal.wrnch.ai/wrnchai_edge/releases) and download the **wrnchAI Engine for Win10**. The file will be something like `wrnchAI-Engine-1.17.0-GPU-Win10.zip`
3. Once downloaded, extract the .zip file and locate the **wrnchAI trained models folder** for use in the CHOP's 'Model Folder' parameter. It should be located here: `wrnchAI-engine-GPU-1.17.0-Windows-amd64/bin/wrModels`

The wrnchAI CHOP will take a few moments to initialize and then will be ready for tracking. Initializing is only required when a new Model Folder is introduced, it will not need to re-initialize each time the project is started.

XML DAT - TouchDesigner Documentation

# XML DAT

The XML DAT can be used to parse arbitrary XML and SGML/HTML formatted data. Once formatted, selected sections of the text can be output for further processing.

One approach to parsing with the XML DAT is to read the XML with a Text DAT or a Web DAT, and pass that to a default XML DAT. Then you start to refine your selection by changing the match-all pattern (the "\*"), to strings that reduce the elements that are in the output.

### XML and HTML Background

XML and HTML data consists of a tree like structure consisting of elements. Each element can be either tagged or contain arbitrary text. Elements may be nested. Tagged elements begin with an opening section and usually are terminated with a closing section.

```
 <greeting a="1" b="2" c="3"> Hello there. </greeting>

In the example above are two elements. The first is a **tag** element named *greeting* with attributes *a, b* and *c*. The second element is a **text** element consisting of "*Hello there.*"

### XML DAT Operation

The XML DAT begins by parsing its input, creating an internal tree of elements.

The **Element Scope** parameters are then used to filter out unwanted elements. The remaining elements are then used to create the output. The format of the output is determined by the **Format** parameters. The **Output** parameters can then be used to futher limit the information displayed for each scoped element.

Each parsed element contains a number of details:

**Label** - Each element is given an arbitrary label named n0, n1, n2 etc. All elements are children of the reserved element labelled 'root'.

**Type** - Elements are mainly of type 'tag' or 'text', though tag types can be further classified into 'doctype', 'declaration', 'comment' or 'entity'.

**Text** - The text of an element refers to the tag attribute of an element, or the arbitrary text contents. In the above example, the first element would be of type 'tag' and contain text of 'greeting'. The second element would be of type 'text' and contain text of 'Hello there.'

**Level** - This describes how deeply nested an element is. For example the single root element always has a level of 0.

**Parent** - Each element contains one parent. The root element does not have a parent.

**Children** - Each element can have an arbitrary number of children elements.

**Attributes** - Each tagged element can have an arbitrary number of attributes. Each attribute consists of a name and a value. In the above example, the greeting tag would contain 3 attributes (with names a, b and c and values 1, 2, and 3 respectively).

ZED CHOP - TouchDesigner Documentation

# ZED CHOP

The ZED CHOP reads positional and plane tracking from the ZED camera. It can additionally use a UV to find plane in the room, and return information about that plane such as it's size/orientation either relative to the camera, or the room itself.

Additionally, the ZED CHOP can do skeleton tracking by enabling the 'Body Tracking' menu.

**NOTE:** This CHOP works with the [Stereolabs ZED](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed/) hardware.
For more information and to know what ZED SDK to install refer to the [ZED](ZED.html "ZED") article.

See also [ZED TOP](ZED_TOP.html "ZED TOP") and [ZED SOP](ZED_SOP.html "ZED SOP").
