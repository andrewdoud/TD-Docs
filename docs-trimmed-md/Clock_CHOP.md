## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Clock CHOP generates channels that reflect the time of year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond. It also has a moon cycle channel. It provides the date as separate channels and in different units. It presents the time in two ways:
* It generates **0-1 ramps** that reflect the time of year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second and millisecond.
* It generates **integers that reflects the day-of month** etc. In this form the year channel is 4 for 2004, etc.
There are sunrise/sunset features, and you can override the day-of-year by inputting 1-6 channels into the CHOP.

## Parameters - Clock Page
Output `output` - ⊞ - Fractions or Units affects the channel data that is output from the Clock CHOP. Fraction gives convenient 0-1 ramps and Units give integers, like 0-23 for the hours of a day. For example, use Fractions and the day, hour and minute channels to drive a wall clock.
* Units `units` -
* Fractions `fractions` -
Hour Format `hourformat` - ⊞ - 12 hour or 24 hour - Causes the hour channel to cycle through 12 or 24 hours. Also affects the AM/PM channel.
* 12 hour `12` -
* 24 hour `24` -
Hour Adjust `houradjust` - After the Clock CHOP reads the current time, it adds Hour Adjust to pretend the current time is different than the actual current time.
Start Reference `startref` - ⊞ - The date/time that corresponds to year 0, day 1, hour 0, minute 0. It can be relative to Jan 1, 2000 or to the time that the TouchDesigner process started.
* Since Jan 1 2000 `jan1` -
* Since Program Start `program` -
Millisecond `msec` - If Output is Units, it is the current millisecond, starting at 0 at the start of a second, going up to 999 at the end of a second. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a millisecond.
Second `sec` - If Output is Units, it is the current second, starting at 0 for on-the-hour, going up to 59. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a second (45 seconds past the minute gives .75).
Minute `min` - If Output is Units, it is the current minute, starting at 0 for on-the-hour, going up to 59. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a minute (45 seconds past the minute gives .75).
Hour `hour` - If Output is Units, it is the current hour, starting at 0 for midnight and affected by AM/PM. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of an hour (15 minutes past the hour gives .25), taking into account the current minute and second.
AM/PM `ampm` - 0 if before noon, 1 if after noon.
Day of Week `wday` - If Output is Units, it is the actual day of the week, starting with 0 for Monday and 6 for Sunday.
Day of Month `day` - If Output is Units, it is the actual day of the month, so on March 20, it is 20. If Output is Fraction, it is fraction of a day of the current moment, so at 6:30 PM, it is .77, taking into account the hour, minute and second.
Day of Year `yday` - If Output is Units, it is the Day of year, starting with 0 for January 1. If it is Fraction, it is the same as Day of Month.
Week `week` - Week of the year, starting with 0 for the first week and 51 for the last week of the year.
Month `month` - Month of the year, starting with 1 for January and 12 for December.
Year `year` - If Output is Units, it is the integer year number relative to the Start Reference, starting at 0, so year 2009 is 9 by default. If Output is Fraction, it is the current fraction of a year, taking into account today's month, day, hour, minute and second.
  

## Parameters - Solar Page
Latitude `latitude` - ⊞ - Enter a latitude (hours/min north/south) of your location. (defaults to Toronto, Canada). Fractional hours are permitted. For example: 43.6532 hours and 0 minutes, is identical to 43 hours and 39 minutes. The parameter latitude1 is hours, latitude2 is minutes.
* `latitude1` -
* `latitude2` -
NS `northsouth` - ⊞ - Set if the Latitude value above is in the north or south hemisphere.
* North `north` -
* South `south` -
Longitude `longitude` - ⊞ - Enter a longitude (hours/min east/west) of your location. Fractional hours are permitted. The parameter longitude1 is hours, longitude2 is minutes.
* `longitude1` -
* `longitude2` -
EW `eastwest` - ⊞ - Set if the Longitude value above is in the east or west hemisphere.
* East `east` -
* West `west` -
Moon Phase `moonphase` - Outputs the moon phase (0 to 1. .5 is a full moon, 0 and 1 are at the time of the new moon).
Sun Phase `sunphase` - (0 to 1, where sunrise=0, sunset = 1, and it reverses down to 0 in time for the sunrise.
Sunrise `sunrise` - Outputs the sunrise time (0 to 1, midnight=0, twenty-four hours later = 1).
Sunset `sunset` - Outputs the sunset time (0 to 1, midnight=0, twent.y-four hours later = 1).
Declination `declination` - (-180 to 180, degrees north/south that the sun is off the equator).
  

## Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.
Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.
* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.
Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

A [Link](Link.html "Link"). The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").
The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or [Link](Link.html "Link")). A Reference is (1) a [Parameter Reference](Parameter_Reference.html "Parameter Reference"), a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a [Node Reference](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Node_Reference&action=edit&redlink=1 "Node Reference (page does not exist)"), an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.
A Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP [Exports](Export.html "Export"), node [Paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path") in parameters, and [expressions](Expression.html "Expression") in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a [Wire](Wire.html "Wire") that connects nodes in the same [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").

A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.

A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.

samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.

Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.

TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.
