## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Environment Light Component controls the color and intensity of an environmental light in a given scene. This light, unlike the [Light Component](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP"), has no particular position. It comes from outside all of the objects in the scene and lights them. The orientation of the objects and the Environment Light Map will affect how each side of the objects is lit. However the position of the objects in space will have no effect on how the environment light hits them.

## Parameters - Light Page
You can modify the color of the light three ways: Color List, Hue, Saturation, and Value, or Red, Green, and Blue. To choose one, click on the appropriate box and the color editing fields below change accordingly.
Light Color `c` - ⊞ - You can modify the color of the light three ways: Color List, Hue, Saturation, and Value, or Red, Green, and Blue. To choose one, click on the appropriate box and the color editing fields below change accordingly.
* Red `cr` -
* Green `cg` -
* Blue `cb` -
Dimmer `dimmer` - This parameter allows you to change the intensity of the light either as a static value or over time.
Environment Map `envlightmap` - Uses a TOP texture to define an environment map for the material. Environment mapping simulates an object reflecting its surroundings. The TOP defined in this parameter is the texture that will be reflected. The Env Map is added to whatever the normal lighting will be, so to make an object purely reflective turn the Diffuse and Specular parameters to 0. This input expects a sphere map. An example of a sphere map can be found [here](http://debevec.org/Probes/campus_probe.jpg). This input will also accept a cube map, created with the [Cube Map TOP](Cube_Map_TOP.html "Cube Map TOP") or the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP")'s Render Cube Map parameter.
Environment Map 2D Type `envlightmaptype2d` - ⊞ - Select the type of environment map to use (only equirectangular available for now).
* Equirectangular `equirect` - Use equirectangular format for the environment map.
Environment Map Quality `envlightmapquality` - Controls the number of samples used by the Environment Light which determines the quality of the result. This value is multiplied by the [PBR MATs](PBR_MAT.html "PBR MAT") Env Light Quality parameter.
Environment Map Rotate `envlightmaprotate` - ⊞ - Rotate the texture specified by the Environment Map parameter above.
* X `envlightmaprotatex` -
* Y `envlightmaprotatey` -
* Z `envlightmaprotatez` -
Use Pre-Filter Maps `envlightmapprefilter` - ⊞ - Controls how the environment map is pre-filtered. A pre-filtered environment map is expensive to create, but results in much better rendering quality.
* Off `off` - Disables pre-filtering the environment map. This is useful for animated environment maps, which can be far too expensive to pre-filter every frame. The rendering quality will be worse than when pre-filtering.
* Automatic `automatic` - Pre-filter the environment map as needed. This results in the best rendering quality, but is quite expensive if the map changes.
* From Pre-Filter TOP `useprefiltertop` - The output of the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") can be used instead, this allows for manually creating pre-filtered maps, including sequences of images for animated maps. The maps from the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") should be saved in a lossless format.
Pre-Filtered Specular Map `envlightspecmap` - The 'Environment Light Specular Map' output from the [PreFilter Map TOP](PreFilter_Map_TOP.html "PreFilter Map TOP") to use.
  

## Parameters - Render Page
The Display parameter page controls the component's [material](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Material&action=edit&redlink=1 "Material (page does not exist)") and [rendering](Rendering.html "Rendering") settings.
Material `material` - Selects a [MAT](MAT.html "MAT") to apply to the geometry inside.
Render `render` - Whether the Component's geometry is visible in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP"). This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the Component's [Render Flag](Render_Flag.html "Render Flag").
Draw Priority `drawpriority` - Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent Component, or if the Component is the top level one listed in the Render TOP's 'Geometry' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with [Transparency](Transparency.html "Transparency").
Pick Priority `pickpriority` - When using a [Render Pick CHOP](Render_Pick_CHOP.html "Render Pick CHOP") or a [Render Pick DAT](Render_Pick_DAT.html "Render Pick DAT"), there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.
Wireframe Color `wcolor` - ⊞ - Use the R, G, and B fields to set the Component's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.
* Red `wcolorr` -
* Green `wcolorg` -
* Blue `wcolorb` -
Light Mask `lightmask` - By default all lights used in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the [Render TOP](Render_TOP.html "Render TOP") as well as this parameter to be used.
  

## Parameters - Extensions Page
The Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions. Please see [extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions") for more information.
Extension `ext` - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component
Object `ext0object` - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.
Name `ext0name` - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.
Promote `ext0promote` - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the `.ext` member. Example: `n.Somefunction` vs `n.ext.Somefunction`

Re-Init Extensions `reinitextensions` - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.
  

## Parameters - Common Page
The Common parameter page sets the component's [node viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer") and [clone](Clone.html "Clone") relationships.
Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See [Parent Shortcut](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut").
Global OP Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut").
Internal OP `iop` - Sequence header for internal operators.
Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").
OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").

Node View `nodeview` - ⊞ - Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer"). Some options will not be available depending on the Component type ([Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component"), [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component"), Misc.)
* Default Viewer `default` - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a Control Panel Viewer for Panel COMPs.
* Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.
Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](Clone.html "Clone").
Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
Enable External .tox `enableexternaltox` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
Enable External .tox Pulse `enableexternaltoxpulse` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present).
External .tox Path `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
Relative File Path Behavior `relpath` - ⊞ - Set whether the child file paths within this COMP are relative to the .toe itself or the .tox, or inherit from parent.
* Use Parent's Behavior `inherit` - Inherit setting from parent.
* Relative to Project File (.toe) `project` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .toe file.
* Relative to External COMP File (.tox) `externaltox` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .tox file. When no external COMP file is specified, or when Enable External .tox is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.

MATs or Materials are an [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that applies a [Shader](Shader.html "Shader") to a SOP or 3D Geometry Object for rendering textured surfaces with lighting.

The 3D data held in SOPs and passed for rendering by the [Geometry COMP](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP").

Any component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.

The sub-[Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") of [Component](Component.html "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

A Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax `parent.Name`, for example `parent.Effect.width` to obtain panel width.

A name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.

Any of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They "cook" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See [Node](Node.html "Node").

Operator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include [Parent Shortcuts](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut") for accessing a component from within that component, and [Global OP Shortcuts](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut") that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.

The viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer")), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a [Pane](Pane.html "Pane") that graphically shows the results of an operator.

A custom interactive control panel built within TouchDesigner. Panels are created using [Panel Components](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component").

Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](Component.html "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the [Replicator COMP](Replicator_COMP.html "Replicator COMP").

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](Component.html "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.

TOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

There are 2 kinds of parenting. The "parent component" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root `/` is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also [3D Parenting](3D_Parenting.html "3D Parenting") and panel [Parenting](Parent.html "Parent").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.
