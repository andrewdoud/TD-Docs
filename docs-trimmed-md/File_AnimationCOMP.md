TD Pages - Touch Glossary - Keyframe Animation

In the [Animation component](Animation_COMP.html "Animation COMP") each keyframe specifies a channel's value at a specific time (or frame). A keyframe holds a value, slopes and accelerations, and an interpolation type. A channel's keyframes are used to interpolate and determine the values of all the samples of the channel.
