## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Event CHOP manages the birth and life of overlapping events triggered by devices like a MIDI keyboard. It can be seen as a simple particle system designed for MIDI keyboards.
The Event CHOP generates one sample for each off-to-on event in the input channels, which would often come from a [MIDI In CHOP](MIDI_In_CHOP.html "MIDI In CHOP"), [MIDI In Map CHOP](MIDI_In_Map_CHOP.html "MIDI In Map CHOP"), [Keyboard In CHOP](Keyboard_In_CHOP.html "Keyboard In CHOP"), or python events sent to the Event CHOP. The sample exists for the duration of the event's attack+decay+sustain+release time.
**NOTE**: See the examples in Help->[OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets")
The Event CHOP can used to follow a polyphonic music keyboard with MIDI velocity, and can generate generating one object, polygon or geometry instance for each event. It assures the object, polygon or instance exists until the event ends after an attack-decay-sustain-release phase. The Event CHOP is often fed through other OPs to the Instance parameters of a Geometry component.
The Event CHOP outputs up to 8 channels, with one sample generated per off-to-on event that is active. The sample is active until the attack-decay-sustain-release is over, at which moment the sample disappears (like particle death).
Watch the channel graph of the Event CHOP to understand what it is doing. It can be sent to a [Limit SOP](Limit_SOP.html "Limit SOP") or a [Channel SOP](CHOP_to_SOP.html "CHOP to SOP") to place geometry for each event. You can send event information to the SOP via the Event CHOP channels that get transformed into geometry channels like `tx`, `ty`, `scale`, texture v (giving movie time offsets), alpha, r, g and b colors.
On a MIDI keyboard, you can trigger many events simultaneously, and, like particles, you may want to launch objects that remain in existence the next time you press the same key.
The Event CHOP is designed to handle this. It creates one sample every time you press any key, and that sample lives for any length of time. This CHOP is lightweight - the minimum number of channels and samples are created, even with 88-key MIDI keyboards and lots of pounding on the keyboard.
There are channels that represent age, note number and MIDI velocity when you pressed the key, as well as a flag telling if the key has since been released.
Each event has a unique ID, held in the `id` channel that can be used to generate random XY displacements of each note, for example.
A movie index is set by the `state` channel which rises from 0 to 1 and loops between 1 to 2 continuously until the note goes into its release state at which time it goes from 2 to 3. So for a bird cycle, you use the 0 to 1 state for the jump phase, 1 to 2 for the flappin in flight phase, and 2 to 3 for the landing phase.
The Event CHOP's 1st input is for event triggers.
The 2nd input resets the triggers.
The 3rd input is optional and allows for sampling values for each event.

## Parameters - Channels Page
The Event CHOP outputs seven channels that define the properties of the events.
ID `id` - The sequence # of the event, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each event.
Index `index` - The channel index of the incoming CHOP that caused the event.
Active `active` - While the input is greater than 0 this channel goes to 1, ie when the input channel goes "On".
Input `input` - The value of the input channel when the input went on (at the birth of the event). It is often the note velocity value. If you pass the Midi In CHOP into the Event CHOP, and set the Midi In option to output the velocity, velocity will end up in this channel and preserved until the event ends.
Time `time` - Time in seconds from the start of the event.
ADSR `adsr` - The value according to the Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. It uses the parameters on the ADSR page, regulating the speed and values, with extended parameters: Attack Time, Attack Level, Decay Time, Sustain Time, Sustain Min, Sustain Max, Release Time, Release Level.
State `state` - This is good for playing back movies. You divide your movie into 4 parts that correspond to the (0=attack, 1=decay, 2=sustain, 3=release) phases. The state channel outputs fractional values, so you can watch it climb through all the transitions, including multiple sustain-sections. e.g., 0...1...2...2...2...2...3...4. If your movie is 8 seconds long, take the state channel and multiply by 2, passing it as the time-index of the movie.
Goes from 0 to 1 during the attack phase, 1 to 2 as it repeats in the sustain phase, and 2 to 3 in the release phase. It is suitable for indexing movies.

Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - Determines the reset behavior of using the 2nd Input Reset Trigger. This parameter is only active if there is an input connected to the CHOP's 2nd input.
* Off to On `offtoon` -
* While On `on` -
* On to Off `ontooff` -
* While Off `off` -
Reset `reset` - When set to 'On' it resets the CHOP clearing all events.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Immediately resets the CHOP and clears all events in the frame it was clicked.
Callbacks DAT `callbacks` - The path to a DAT containing onCreate() and onDestroy() callbacks for each event.
  

## Parameters - ADSR Page
Attack Time `attacktime` - Affects `adsr` and `state` channel. Time to rise to max attack level.
Attack Time Unit `attacktunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Attack Level `attacklevel` - Affects `adsr` channel. Peak attack level.
Decay Time `decaytime` - Affects `adsr` channel and `state` channel. Time after peak to sustain level.
Decay Time Unit `decaytunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Sustain Time `sustaintime` - Affects `adsr` channel.
Sustain Time Unit `sustaintunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Sustain Min `sustainmin` - Affects `adsr` channel. Level at start of sustain time.
Sustain Max `sustainmax` - Affects `adsr` channel. Level at end of sustain time.

Release Time Unit `releasetunit` - Select the units to use for this parameter, Samples, Frames, or Seconds.
Release Level `releaselevel` - Affects `adsr` channel. Level at end of life cycle.
Speed `speed` - Affects the speed of the event, letting you stretch out or shorten the life of an event.
Global Speed `globalspeed` -
  

## Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.
Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.
* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.
Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

Events are single-moment occurrences that are generated from a variety of conditions - from input actions that a user causes, from external devices and software, and from internal TouchDesigner states. A wide set of operator types respond to events and give the user a place to write python code that reacts to events.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

(1) A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") can instance and render its SOP geometry many times: once for each sample in a CHOP, row of a DAT table, pixel in a TOP, or point of a SOP, (2) An instance is an OP that doesn't actually have its own data, but rather just refers to an OP (or has an input) whose data it uses. This includes Null OPs, Switch OPs and in some cases Select OPs.

A [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that reads, creates and modifies 3D points, polygons, lines, particles, surfaces, spheres and meatballs. Particles and point clouds are now done primarily on the GPU using TOPs.

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.

A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.

samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.

Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.

TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.
