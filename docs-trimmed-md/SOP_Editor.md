The SOP Editor allows you to select, create, and edit geometry in [SOPs](SOP.html "SOP").
To open the SOP Editor, right click on any SOP and select **Model Geometry**. This will lock the node and open up the SOP Editor in a floating pane. For the [Group SOP](Group_SOP.html "Group SOP"), the menu item is **Select Geometry**. The SOP will not be locked, but you will be able to select geometry and transfer the selection to the Group SOP.
