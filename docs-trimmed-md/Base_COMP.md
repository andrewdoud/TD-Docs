## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Base Component has no panel parameters and no 3D object parameters. You would use it for a component that has no panel associated with it, nor any 3D, such as component that converted RGB channels to HSV channels.

## Parameters - Base Page
## Parameters - Extensions Page
The Extensions parameter page sets the component's python extensions. Please see [extensions](Extensions.html "Extensions") for more information.
Extension `ext` - Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component
Object `ext0object` - A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.
Name `ext0name` - Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.
Promote `ext0promote` - Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the `.ext` member. Example: `n.Somefunction` vs `n.ext.Somefunction`

Re-Init Extensions `reinitextensions` - Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.
  

## Parameters - Common Page
The Common parameter page sets the component's [node viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer") and [clone](Clone.html "Clone") relationships.
Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See [Parent Shortcut](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut").
Global OP Shortcut `opshortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See [Global OP Shortcut](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut").
Internal OP `iop` - Sequence header for internal operators.
Shortcut `iop0shortcut` - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").
OP `iop0op` - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See [Internal Operators](Internal_Operators.html "Internal Operators").

Operator Viewer `opviewer` - Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.
Enable Cloning `enablecloning` - Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.
Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse` - Instantaneously clone the contents.
Clone Master `clone` - Path to a component used as the Master [Clone](Clone.html "Clone").
Load on Demand `loadondemand` - Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.
Enable External .tox `enableexternaltox` - When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.
Enable External .tox Pulse `enableexternaltoxpulse` - This button will re-load from the external `.tox` file (if present).
External .tox Path `externaltox` - Path to a `.tox` file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a `.toe`. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the `.tox` file can not be found, whatever the `.toe` file was saved with will be loaded.
Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's [Custom Parameters](Custom_Parameters.html "Custom Parameters") are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin` - When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the [.tox](-2.html ".tox") is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the [.tox](-2.html ".tox").
Save Backup of External `savebackup` - When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External `.tox` parameter is saved in the `.toe` file. This backup copy will be used if the External `.tox` can not be found. This may happen if the `.tox` was renamed, deleted, or the `.toe` file is running on another computer that is missing component media.
Sub-Component to Load `subcompname` - When loading from an External `.tox` file, this option allows you to reach into the `.tox` and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a `.tox` file named `project1.tox` contains `project1/geo1`, putting `geo1` as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in `geo1` being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the `.tox` file normally using the top level COMP in the file.
Relative File Path Behavior `relpath` - ⊞ - Set whether the child file paths within this COMP are relative to the .toe itself or the .tox, or inherit from parent.
* Use Parent's Behavior `inherit` - Inherit setting from parent.
* Relative to Project File (.toe) `project` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .toe file.
* Relative to External COMP File (.tox) `externaltox` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .tox file. When no external COMP file is specified, or when Enable External .tox is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.
  

## Info CHOP Channels
Extra Information for the Base COMP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").

### Common COMP Info Channels
* num\_children - Number of children in this component.
### Common Operator Info Channels
* total\_cooks - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started.
* cook\_time - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.
* cook\_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.
* cook\_abs\_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.
* cook\_start\_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked.
* cook\_end\_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked.
* cooked\_this\_frame - 1 if operator was cooked this frame.
* warnings - Number of warnings in this operator if any.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

Any component can be extended with its own Python classes which contain python functions and data.

The sub-[Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") of [Component](Component.html "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

A Parent Shortcut is a parameter on a component that contains a name that you can use anywhere inside the component to refer to that component using the syntax `parent.Name`, for example `parent.Effect.width` to obtain panel width.

A name for a component that is accessible from any node in a project, which can be declared in a component's Global Operator Shortcut parameter.

Any of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They "cook" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See [Node](Node.html "Node").

Operator shortcuts are Python objects that return operators (or sometimes parameters). These include [Parent Shortcuts](Parent_Shortcut.html "Parent Shortcut") for accessing a component from within that component, and [Global OP Shortcuts](Global_OP_Shortcut.html "Global OP Shortcut") that access a unique component from anywhere in TouchDesigner.

The viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer")), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a [Pane](Pane.html "Pane") that graphically shows the results of an operator.

Cloning makes multiple components match the contents of a master component. A [Component](Component.html "Component") whose Clone parameter is set will be forced to contain the same nodes, wiring and parameters as its master component. Cloning does not create new components as does the [Replicator COMP](Replicator_COMP.html "Replicator COMP").

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

TouchDesigner Component file, the file type used to save a [Component](Component.html "Component") of your TouchDesigner project.

TOuch Environment file, the file type used by TouchDesigner to save your entire project.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

There are 2 kinds of parenting. The "parent component" is the component in which a node resides. The metaphor is extended to include grand parents, grand-grand parents, etc. The root `/` is the ultimate parent to all nodes. See also [3D Parenting](3D_Parenting.html "3D Parenting") and panel [Parenting](Parent.html "Parent").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.
