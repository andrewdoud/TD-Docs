## Parameters - Device Out Page
Active `active` - Enable or disable the output card.
Library `library` - ⊞ - Select the driver library to use.
* Blackmagic `blackmagic` - Supports driver version 12.x
* BlueFish444 `bluefish444` -
* AJA `aja` -
* Deltacast `deltacast` -
Device `device` - ⊞ - A menu of available video devices to output to. Set the Library parameter above prior to selecting your device.
* DeckLink 8K Pro (1) `V1` -
Signal Format `signalformat` - The signal format to output at. This is the resolution and the frame rate, as well as if the frames are progressive or interlaced. Note that when using an interlaced format, the rate refers to fields per second.
Output Pixel Format `outputpixelformat` - ⊞ - Set the pixel format of the output when possible (depends what type of device is used). Data may be converted to YUV colorspace depending on what the device and settings require.
* 8-bit RGB `fixed8` - 8-bit color data, no alpha channel.
* 8-bit + 8-bit Key (Alpha) `fixed8key8` - 8-bit color data and 8-bit alpha. This usually means SDI cables where one cable will be the color data and one cable will be the alpha data.
* 10-bit RGB `fixed10` - 10-bit color data, no alpha.
* 12-bit `fixed12` -
Output Color Space `outputcolorspace` - ⊞ - Set the color space of the data sent out, for supported devices.
* `yuv422` - YUV 4:2:2. This is the most common color space to send data over SDI wires. It requires lower bandwidth than RGB 4:4:4, but results in some information loss.
* `rgb444` - RGB 4:4:4. This is RGB values taken directly from the TOP without any colorspace conversion (except for possibly pixel format). This requires more bandwidth but doesn't suffer from the information loss that YUV 4:2:2 has.
Audio CHOP `chop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") CHOP here.
Reference Source `referencesource` - ⊞ - On AJA devices what input to use as a reference source input.
* Default `default` -
* External Ref In `external` -
* SDI Input 1 `sdi1` -
* SDI Input 2 `sdi2` -
* SDI Input 3 `sdi3` -
* SDI Input 4 `sdi4` -
* SDI Input 5 `sdi5` -
* SDI Input 6 `sdi6` -
* SDI Input 7 `sdi7` -
* SDI Input 8 `sdi8` -
Audio CHOP `audiochop` - If you want to embed audio data into the output, put the path to a [Time Sliced](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Time_Slice&action=edit&redlink=1 "Time Slice (page does not exist)") CHOP here.
Buffer Length `bufferlength` - The length in seconds to buffer the audio data, to avoid crackles and pops.
Audio Bit Depth `audiobitdepth` - ⊞ - Describes the number of bits of information used for each sample.
* 16-Bit `16bit` -
* 32-Bit `32bit` -
Manual Field Control `manualfield` - When outputting interlaced video if you are using a source video that is also interlaced, it's likely you'll want to make sure you are keeping the odd/even fields in sync, otherwise the video will look stuttery. You can use the 'odd\_field' value in the [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP") on the [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP") or [Video Device In TOP](Video_Device_In_TOP.html "Video Device In TOP") to know if the current frame is the odd field or the even field. In general the odd field is the first frame, so you use this value in the First Field parameter to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the first field. On the next frame you would put this value to 0 (which is also what the 'odd\_frame' will go to) to tell the Video Device Out TOP that the current frame is the 2nd frame, and you now have a complete frame to output. Deinterlacing should be enabled on the Video Device In or Movie File In TOP, so that fields are fed into the network one at a time.
First Field `firstfield` - Tells the Video Device Out TOP if the current frame being given as it's input is the First or Second field in the final output image, when outputting an interlaced video. Look at the description for Manual Field Control for more information.
Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop` - Embed timecode into the output. A reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a [Timecode Class](Timecode_Class.html "Timecode Class") object.
Transfer Mode `transfermode` - ⊞ - Controls how the image data is transfered between the GPU and the output card.
* Automatic `automatic` - Will choose the best transfer mode for the components installed on the computer. It will choose 'Pinned' when possible, since that is the best performance.
* Default `default` - Transfer will be done in 3 stages. GPU to CPU memory. CPU memory to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.
* Pinned `pinned` - Transfer will be done in 2 stages. GPU to driver memory. Driver memory to output card.
Sync Outputs `syncoutputs` - Only currently supported on the [Deltacast](Deltacast.html "Deltacast") FLEX line of cards. This will cause multiple FLEX cards to output their content in sync with each other.
Sync Group Index `syncgroupindex` - For different groups of cards, they can be ganged together into different sync groups by specifying the same index for multiple cards in the same group.
Reset Stats `resetstats` - A pulse to reset the statistics in an attached [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").
  

## Parameters - Common Page
Output Resolution `outputresolution` - ⊞ - quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.
* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
* Eighth `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Quarter `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Half `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 2X `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 4X `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* 8X `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
* Fit Resolution `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* Limit Resolution `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
* Custom Resolution `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.
Resolution `resolution` - ⊞ - Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.
* W `resolutionw` -
* H `resolutionh` -
Resolution Menu `resmenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.
Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult` - Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in **Edit>Preferences>TOPs**. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.
Output Aspect `outputaspect` - ⊞ - Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)
* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
* Resolution `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
* Custom Aspect `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.
Aspect `aspect` - ⊞ - Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.
* Aspect1 `aspect1` -
* Aspect2 `aspect2` -
Aspect Menu `armenu` - A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.
Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.
* Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
* Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
* Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses  [mipmap](Mipmapping.html "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.
Fill Viewer `fillmode` - ⊞ - Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer.
**NOTE:**To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to **Native Resolution** as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.
* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
* Fill `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
* Fit Horizontal `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
* Fit Vertical `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
* Fit Best `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
* Fit Outside `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
* Native Resolution `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.
Viewer Smoothness `filtertype` - ⊞ - This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.
* Nearest Pixel `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
* Interpolate Pixels `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
* Mipmap Pixels `mipmap` - Uses  [mipmap](Mipmapping.html "Mipmapping") filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.
Passes `npasses` - Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.
Channel Mask `chanmask` - Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
Pixel Format `format` - ⊞ - Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to [Pixel Formats](Pixel_Formats.html "Pixel Formats") for more information.
* Use Input `useinput` - Uses the input's pixel format.
* 8-bit fixed (RGBA) `rgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel.

* 11-bit float (RGB), Positive Values Only `rgba11float` - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue Channel, 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
* 16-bit float (RGB) `rgb16float` -
* 32-bit float (RGB) `rgb32float` -
* 8-bit fixed (Mono) `mono8fixed` - Single channel, where RGB will all have the same value, and Alpha will be 1.0. 8-bits per pixel.

## Info CHOP Channels
Extra Information for the Video Device Out TOP can be accessed via an [Info CHOP](Info_CHOP.html "Info CHOP").
### Specific Video Device Out TOP Info Channels
* connected - 1 if the device is connected/active, 0 if not.
  

* play\_speed - The play speed of the audio data. 1 if it's playing at normal speed, it'll be slightly faster or slower if it's needing to adjust the queue size to hit the target size.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that creates, composites and modifies images, and reads/writes images and movies to/from files and the network. TOPs run on the graphics card's GPU.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

A [Link](Link.html "Link"). The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").
The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or [Link](Link.html "Link")). A Reference is (1) a [Parameter Reference](Parameter_Reference.html "Parameter Reference"), a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a [Node Reference](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Node_Reference&action=edit&redlink=1 "Node Reference (page does not exist)"), an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.
A Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP [Exports](Export.html "Export"), node [Paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path") in parameters, and [expressions](Expression.html "Expression") in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a [Wire](Wire.html "Wire") that connects nodes in the same [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").

The sub-[Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") of [Component](Component.html "Component") types that are used to define and render 3D scenes. A [Geometry Component](Geometry_COMP.html "Geometry COMP") is an Object that contains the 3D shapes to render. A [Camera COMP](Camera_COMP.html "Camera COMP") and [Light COMP](Light_COMP.html "Light COMP") are other Object types. Separately, "Objects" also refers to Python objects.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

The Graphics Processing Unit. This is the high-speed, many-core processor of the graphics card/chip that takes geometry, images and data from the CPU and creates images and processed data.

The width and height of an image in pixels. Most TOPs, like the [Movie File In TOP](Movie_File_In_TOP.html "Movie File In TOP") can set the image resolution. See [Aspect Ratio](TOP_Generator_Common_Page.html "TOP Generator Common Page") for the width/height ratio of an image, taking into account non-square pixels.

The viewer of a node can be (1) the interior of a node (the [Node Viewer](Node_Viewer.html "Node Viewer")), (2) a floating window (RMB->View... on node), or (3) a [Pane](Pane.html "Pane") that graphically shows the results of an operator.

A [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP") outputs one or more channels, where a channel is simply a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample")), representing motion, audio, etc. Channels are passed between CHOPs in TouchDesigner networks. Channels can be [Exported](Export.html "Export") to [Parameters](Parameter.html "Parameter").
