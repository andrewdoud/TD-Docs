## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Beat CHOP generates a variety of ramps, pulses and counters that are timed to the beats per minute and the sync as produced by the [Beat Dialog](Beat_Dialog.html "Beat Dialog").
* You can generate a ramp every 1/4 1/2 1 2 4 8 32 beats.
* You can generate ramps of any other length, like 12 beats per bar (ramp) and fractional beats like 3.33 beats per ramp.
* You can generate a set of channels, where each channel is delayed relative to the prior channel. This is useful, for example, for moving eight objects delayed by one beat each.
* There also is a counter of how many ramps it has generated.
* The Count+Ramp type generates a continuously-rising ramp equal to the number of cycles since the start.
* If Play Mode is set to Local Sequential, it doesn't look at start/end of the timeline (i.e. doesn't reset when the timeline loops), so is more appropriate for long improvised playing.
**Note:** for the purposes of this dialog, a *bar* is 4 beats and the *period* is the number of beats set by the Period parameter.
The [Beat Dialog](Beat_Dialog.html "Beat Dialog") is used to manually tap the beat to set the beats-per-minute (BPM). The Beat CHOP converts the BPM into a repeating ramp or pulse that keeps time with the music after you stop tapping.
You can set the global beats-per-minute with the python command: `op('/local/time').tempo = 140`
The phase can be controlled with the Beat CHOP's Reset parameters.
The Beat CHOP's timing is defined by the [Component Time](Component_Time.html "Component Time") of the Reference Node. If the Reference Node parameter is left blank, then the time defined at the Beat CHOP's location is used. The default is in `/local/time`.

## Parameters - Beat Page
Reference Operator `op` - This node is used to specify the time settings referenced by the Beat CHOP. The time is defined by the Time COMP found at `timepath("reference_node")`
Use Reference Time Slice `reftimeslice` - Turn on this checkbox to use the [Time Slicing](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing") used by the Reference Node.
Play Mode `playmode` - ⊞ - Specifies the method used to playback the output.
* Locked to Timeline `locked` - This mode locks the output to the local component [Timeline](Timeline.html "Timeline"). Scrubbing or jumping in the local time will update the output accordingly. When the local timeline loops the output is reset and starts over. The output will be the same for each pass through the local timeline.
* Locked to Global `global` - This mode locks the output to the Global beat source. It will follow the Beat CHOP with whose 'Update Global' flag is turned on.
* Local Sequential `local` - This mode produces a continuous output regardless of the timeline position.
Period `period` - Number of beats it takes to generate one cycle of ramp. Use the drop down menu to select from some commonly used Period lengths.
Multiples `multiples` - The number of channels to create.
Shift Offset `shiftoffset` - Delays all channels by this amount. 0 = no change, .5 means 50% of one period later.
Shift Step `shiftstep` - When set to 1, and Multiples is 5, each ramp channel is 1/5 cycle later than the previous channel. When set to .1, the delay is 1/50 cycle. This is a way to stagger the channels.
Random Offset `randoffset` - The amount that each ramp is randomly time-shifted relative to a perfect ramp.
Random Seed `randseed` - Changing this generates a different set of random offsets.
Reset Condition `resetcondition` - ⊞ - This menu determines how the Reset input triggers a reset of the channel(s).
* Off to On `offtoon` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off to on.
* While On `on` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns off.
* On to Off `ontooff` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes on to off.
* While Off `off` - Channels are reset when the Reset input goes off. The channel will hold the reset value until the input turns on.
Reset Bar Value `resetbarvalue` - Specifies which Bar the Beat CHOP will jump to when the Reset Condition is met. Beat values are derived from the fractional part of this value.
Wait after Reset `resetwait` - When using the **While On** Reset Condition, Wait After Reset will hold the channels at zero until the next bar is started, after which the output will continue. When Wait After Reset is off, the channels will restart output as soon as the reset condition is done.
Reset `reset` - This button resets the ramps to zero when On. The ramp is also zero when the Beat CHOP's input is above 0.
Reset Pulse `resetpulse` - Instantly resets the ramps to zero.
Update Global `updateglobal` - Any Beat CHOP can be made the "global beat source" by turning on Update Global. A reference Beat CHOP is created at /local/master\_beat (if it doesn't already exist) and all Beat CHOPs can synchronize to this by setting 'Play Mode: Locked to Global'. That master Beat CHOP also needs 'Update Global' turned on, if not already on. This means you require exactly one master Beat CHOP per toe. You can turn switch back to 'Play Mode: Locked to Sequential' when desired. $MASTER\_BEAT is set to whatever Beat CHOP has this option turned on.
  

## Parameters - Output Page
Ramp `ramp` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each period.
Pulse `pulse` - Outputs a pulse each period.
Sine `sine` - Outputs a sine wave each period.
Count `count` - Increases the count each period.
Count+Ramp `countramp` - A ramp that counts up until the bar is reset.
Bar `bar` - Output the current bar.
Beat `beat` - Output the current beat.
Sixteenths `sixteenths` - Output the current sixteenths.
Ramp Bar `rampbar` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.
Ramp Beat `rampbeat` - Outputs a 0-1 ramp each beat.
BPM `bpm` - Outputs the current BPM.
  

## Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.
Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.
* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.
Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

A [Link](Link.html "Link"). The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference or Link that indicates one operator is getting data from another operator from any [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").
The grey dashed lines between nodes is a Reference (or [Link](Link.html "Link")). A Reference is (1) a [Parameter Reference](Parameter_Reference.html "Parameter Reference"), a parameter in an OP that is a name or path to another operator, (2) a [Node Reference](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Node_Reference&action=edit&redlink=1 "Node Reference (page does not exist)"), an expression in a parameter or DAT script that contains the name or path of another operator, (3) a DAT Cell Reference or (4) a CHOP Channel Reference.
A Link or Reference is a dashed line between nodes that represent other data flowing between nodes. Examples are CHOP [Exports](Export.html "Export"), node [Paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path") in parameters, and [expressions](Expression.html "Expression") in parameters referencing CHOP channels, DAT tables and other nodes. In contrast is a [Wire](Wire.html "Wire") that connects nodes in the same [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family").

The generic thing that holds an [Operator](Operator.html "Operator"), and includes [Flags](Flag.html "Flag") (display, bypass, lock, render, immune) and its position/size in the network. Whether you "lay down an Operator" or "lay down an Node", you're doing the same thing.

Any of the procedural data operators. OPs do all the work in TouchDesigner. They "cook" and output data to other OPs, which ultimately result in new images, data and audio being generated. See [Node](Node.html "Node").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that contains its own [Network](Network.html "Network"). There are sixteen 3D [Object Component](Object_Component.html "Object Component") and ten 2D [Panel Component](Panel_Component.html "Panel Component") types. See also [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path").

A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.

The panel at the bottom of TouchDesigner, it controls the current global looping [Time](Time_COMP.html "Time COMP") your TouchDesigner project, or of just one component.

To "pulse" a parameter is to send it a signal from (1) an [exported](Export.html "Export") CHOP channel or (2) a python command or (3) a mouse click that causes a new action to occur immediately. A pulse via python is via the `.pulse()` function on a pulse-type parameter, such as Reset parameter in a [Speed CHOP](Speed_CHOP.html "Speed CHOP"). A pulse from a CHOP is typically a 0 to 1 to 0 signal in an exported channel.

A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.

samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.

Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.

TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.
