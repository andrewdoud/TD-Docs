## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]
The Blob Track CHOP allows tracking blobs in 2D point data.
Input data should be have two channels named *tx* and *ty* describing the 2D points in cartesian coordinates. See the [OP Snippets](OP_Snippets.html "OP Snippets") examples.
Good sources for input scans are the [Hokuyo CHOP](Hokuyo_CHOP.html "Hokuyo CHOP") (in Cartesian coordinate mode) and the [Leuze ROD4 CHOP](Leuze_ROD4_CHOP.html "Leuze ROD4 CHOP"). These devices naturally output a radial scan from the device as the center point, where each point represents (angle, distance). Outputting each scan point in Cartesian coordinate mode gives an (x,y) for each point which is the format required for the Blob Track CHOP.
But any set of (x,y) points in the two channels will be analyzed. The tracker looks for consecutive points close to each other, and handles the case where one blob passes behind another blob giving the hidden blob a linear motion for a specifiable amount of time while it occluded before it removes the blob from the set of blobs being output.

## Parameters - Tracker Page
Active `active` - While on, the CHOP receives information from the input. While off, no processing occurs. Existing blobs will remain.
Search Mode `searchmode` - ⊞ - Controls how searching for blobs is done across all the points.
* All `all` - All the points are compared against each other to find blobs. This mode is slower but more robust for data that has the points randomly assorted in the CHOP.
* Consecutive Points `consecutive` - Points are only compared against points in neighbouring samples of the CHOP data to find blobs. This is much faster but the data much be setup such that points that are close to each other in space are next to each other in the CHOP samples. Data coming from devices such as the [Hokuyo CHOP](Hokuyo_CHOP.html "Hokuyo CHOP") and [Leuze ROD4 CHOP](Leuze_ROD4_CHOP.html "Leuze ROD4 CHOP") output data in this format.
Max Blobs `maxblobs` - The maximum number of blobs that can be tracked.
Max Point Distance in Blob `maxpointdistance` - Two measured points from the input are considered to be part of the same blob if they are this distance or closer to each other.
Max Blob Movement `maxblobmovement` - This controls the maximum distance a blob can move between successive frames and still be considered the same 'blob'.
Area of Interest `areaofinterest` - ⊞ - Limits the area in which blobs are tracked. Points outside the area of interest are ignored.
* Off `off` - No limitations, blobs tracked throughout the scanned area.
* Rectangle `rectangle` - Blobs only tracked within specified rectangle.
* Circle `circle` - Blobs only tracked within specified circle (or ellipse).
Center `center` - ⊞ - The center of the area of interest.
* Center `centerx` -
* Center `centery` -
Size `size` - ⊞ - The size of the area of interest.
* Size `sizew` -
* Size `sizeh` -
Rotate `rotate` - Rotate the area of interest.
Allow Movement Outside Area `allowmovementoutside` - When this is on, blobs detected within the Area of Interest can move outside of that area and still be tracked. When this is off blobs that move outside the area of interest will stop being tracked.
  

## Parameters - Blobs Page
Output Centroid `outputcentroid` - Include the centroid of detected blobs as part of the output channels.
Output Velocity `outputvelocity` - Include the velocity of detected blobs as part of the output channels.
Min Points per Blob `minblobpoints` - Minimum number of points that must be near each other to form a blob. Use to help filter out false positives.
Blob Init Time (s) `blobinittime` - Amount of time a blob must be detected to be considered trustworthy. Use to help filter out false positives. A blob will only be output if it's been detected for at least time amount of time.
Lost Blob Timeout (s) `lostblobtimeout` - The amount of time before a blob that has been lost is removed from the output.
Blob Movement Prediction Type `predicttype` - ⊞ - With prediction enabled, blobs from the last frame have their new position predicted before being matched to the current frame.
* Off `off` - Blobs are matched against the blob positions from the last frame.
* Simple Forward Predict `simple` - Prediction uses constant velocity assumption; blobs are moved the same distance that they moved last frame.
* Kalman Filter Predict `kalman` - Prediction uses [kalman filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter), with a constant velocity model, to move the blobs forward from last frame.
  

## Parameters - Common Page
Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.
* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.
Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.
* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.
Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.

Each SOP has a list of Points. Each point has an XYZ 3D position value plus other optional attributes. Each polygon [Primitive](Primitive.html "Primitive") is defined by a vertex list, which is list of point numbers.

A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.

A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.

samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.

Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.

The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").

Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.

TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.
