## Summary[[edit](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Template:Summary&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: Summary")]

The Audio Para EQ CHOP (parametric [equalizer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio))) applies up to 3 parametric filters to the incoming sound. The three filters are in series, where internally, the second filter takes its input from the output of the first filter, and so on.

It is called parametric because each filter has 3 controls - center frequency, bandwidth and boost, which in the old days, was more than usual analog filters.

Each filter has a center frequency (the Frequency parameter) where the filter will have the most effect, and a bandwidth which is roughly expressed in octaves, and is typically 3 or 4. The Boost parameter, when it is greater than 0, will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.

You can best hear the effects of the Audio Para EQ CHOP by passing it rich-spectrum music. The Audio Para EQ CHOP is implemented with three 4-pole filters internally.

Input 2-4: See [Frequency Modulation Channels](Audio_Para_EQ_CHOP.html#Frequency_Modulation_Channels_Input "Audio Para EQ CHOP"), and the Scope parameter.

The Audio Para EQ CHOP is implemented as three 4-pole filters in series.

## Parameters - Parametric EQ Page

Frequency Units `units` - ⊞ - How frequency is expressed:

* Logarithmic `logarithmic` - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed as a power-of-10. See Frequency (Hz = 10\*\*val) below.

* Frequency `frequency` - The filter cutoff frequency can be expressed in Hz.

Enable EQ1 `enableeq1` - When off, it passes the sound through the first equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ1 `boost1` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ1 `frequencylog1` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ1 `frequencyhz1` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ1 `bandwidth1` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Enable EQ2 `enableeq2` - When off, it passes the sound through the second equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ2 `boost2` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ2 `frequencylog2` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ2 `frequencyhz2` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ2 `bandwidth2` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Enable EQ3 `enableeq3` - When off, it passes the sound through the third equalizer unchanged.
Boost (dB) EQ3 `boost3` - When boost is greater than 0, it will make louder the audio around the center frequency. When boost is less than 0, it will make the audio quieter around the center frequency. Boost is in decibels (dB) where 0 dB has no effect.
Frequency (Hz=10\*\*val) EQ3 `frequencylog3` - The frequency is expressed in power-of-10, where value 0 translates to 1 Hz (10\*\*0), value 1 is 10 Hz (10\*\*1), value 2 is 100 Hz (10\*\*2), value 3 is 1000 Hz, value 4 is 10,000 Hz, value 4.5 is 31,623 Hz. The parameter in this form gives more meaningful range in relation to human hearing, as increasing the parameter by 1 raises the frequency by about 3 octaves.
Frequency (Hz) EQ3 `frequencyhz3` - The filter frequency is expressed in Hz (cycles per second). This parameter set to 1000 has exactly the same effect as the above parameter set to 3.
Bandwidth EQ3 `bandwidth3` - Bandwidth determines how much the levels decrease near the center frequency, expressed in octaves.
Dry / Wet Mix `drywet` - As this parameter is reduced from 1 (Wet) toward 0 (Dry), it removes the effect of the filter.

  


## Parameters - Common Page

Time Slice `timeslice` - Turning this on forces the channels to be "[Time Sliced](Time_Slicing.html "Time Slicing")". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.
Scope `scope` - To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See [Pattern Matching](Pattern_Matching.html "Pattern Matching").
Sample Rate Match `srselect` - ⊞ - Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

* Resample At First Input's Rate `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.

* Resample At Maximum Rate `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.

* Resample At Minimum Rate `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.

* Error If Rates Differ `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

Export Method `exportmethod` - ⊞ - This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the [Export](Export.html "Export") article for more information.

* DAT Table by Index `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.

* DAT Table by Name `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.

* Channel Name is Path:Parameter `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has `geo1/transform1:tx`.

Export Root `autoexportroot` - This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** are relative to.
Export Table `exporttable` - The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

  


## Frequency Modulation Channels Input

The second input is the **Frequency Modulation Channels**, which allows the filter parameters to be changed within the CHOP's time slice interval (typically 1/60 sec). This prevents audible stepping of the parameters that you are changing quickly.

You can send in a channel called `frequency` to override the value of the parameter. You would do this if you want to adjust the center frequency very quickly. The parameter can only change as fast as the timeline rate, typically 1/60 seconds. Changed quickly, the stepping in frequency is noticable. To improve on that, you would send a `frequency` channel in that is at a higher sample rate, like 400, which you can set in a CHOP like an LFO CHOP.

An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") which operate on [Channels](Channel.html "Channel") (a sequence of numbers ([Samples](Sample.html "Sample"))) which are used for animation, audio, mathematics, simulation, logic, UI construction, and data streamed from/to devices and protocols.


A parameter in most CHOPs that restricts which channels of that CHOP will be affected. Normally all channels of a CHOP are affected by the operator. TOPs have Channel Mask, a similar feature.


A Time Slice is the time from the last cook frame to the current cook frame. In CHOPs it is the set of short channels that contain the CHOP channels' samples between the last and the current cook frame.


samples-per-second of a [CHOP](CHOP.html "CHOP"). Each CHOP in your network has a sample rate. In contrast, the overall timeline has a [Frame Rate](Frame_Rate.html "Frame Rate"), which is the number of frames to [cook](Cook.html "Cook") and display per second, generally your monitor display frequency, default 60.


Exporting is the connection of CHOP channels to parameters of operators. The output of each exporting CHOP is one or more channels, active only while the [CHOP Viewer](CHOP_Viewer.html "CHOP Viewer") is on. The current value of a channel can be exported to a parameter of any operator, overriding that parameter's value. See [Parameter](Parameter.html "Parameter").


An [Operator Family](Operator_Family.html "Operator Family") that manipulates text strings: multi-line text or tables. Multi-line text is often a python [Script](Script.html "Script") or [GLSL](GLSL.html "GLSL") Shader, but can be any multi-line text. [Tables](Table_DAT.html "Table DAT") are rows and columns of cells, each containing a text string.


The location of an operator within the TouchDesigner environment, for example, `/geo1/circle1`, a node called `circle1` in a component called `geo1`. The path `/` is called [Root](Root.html "Root"). This path is displayed at the top of every [Pane](Pane.html "Pane"), showing which Component's network you are currently in. To refer instead to a filesystem folder, directory, disk file or `http:` address, see [Folder](Folder.html "Folder").


Every operator in TouchDesigner has a set of control Parameters that can be integer or floating point numbers, menus, binary toggles, text strings or operator [paths](Network_Path.html "Network Path"), which determine the output of the operator.


TouchDesigner is a hierarchy of components. "root" is the top-most network in the hierarchy. The [Network Path](Network_Path.html "Network Path") or Path for root is simply `/`. A typical path is `/project1/moviein1`.
